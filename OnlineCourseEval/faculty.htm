                                	The focus for the 2013/2014 academic year will be to assist Deans, Chairs & Program Coordinators in mapping Course Evaluation data to student/program learning outcomes for program accreditation, QEP and other assessment needs. In late Summer 2013, we launched a new reporting tool that allows administrators (Chairs/Deans) to easily map aggregate responses of selected courses to specific learning outcomes in their assessment plans. For assistance in setting up Program Outcomes Reporting (POR), please contact <a href="mailto:ERAUeval@erau.edu?Subject=Enhancements" target="_top">Institutional Research</a>.<br><br>
									Also, as of Fall 2013, faculty and administrators can use the Results Feedback feature within the Project Results module. This feature supports a dialogue about the results between instructors and administrators.  Instructors can review their results and send comments to their department chair or administrator, and administrators can review the results for those instructors they oversee and then easily provide feedback to each of their instructors.  Feedback from this process is centralized within EvaluationKIT along with the results, and users can export a PDF of their dialogue, and choose to email their feedback outside of the system too.

                                	Beginning with the March 2012 Worldwide term and Summer 2012 residential terms, we activated a student notification window to remind students of open evaluations. This window appeared when the student signed into their Blackboard account. Online courses showed a greater bump in response rates than did ground or traditional courses.  In July 2012, the “Custom Questions” functionality opened to faculty and administrators at Worldwide, with a roll-out to the residential campuses in Fall 2012. Custom Questions allows additional questions to be added to the end of the evaluations to address: teaching effectiveness; assessment; program review; QEP and/or other accreditation needs. Additionally, we attended department meetings and customized the conversation to address their response rates, the new enhancements, and additional training on longitudinal reporting.

                                	During Spring 2010 we conducted student focus groups and engaged in conversations with the residential campus’ SGA and Faculty Senate to gather feedback regarding options to increase course evaluation response rates. Enhancements that were implemented included: increased survey window to 14 days; increased student reminders to 4, 10 & 13 days after survey start date; added faculty and administrator reminder at 7 days after the survey start date; encouraged faculty to share how they use evaluations in class and to include evaluations into the syllabus; made reports available to faculty of respondents/non-respondents for personal follow-up (only emails, name and id appear on report); revised the language in the student emails; increased advertising; and included presentations regarding the value of evaluations in our College Success courses.

                                	In the summer of 2007, Embry-Riddle began its migration from paper course evaluations to an online system.  With a successful launch at our Worldwide campus (150+ teaching centers and online courses), our two residential campuses (Daytona Beach, FL, and Prescott, AZ) went live for Fall 2007 evaluations with response rates in the low 60%’s.  Our Worldwide centers had more variable response rates (20% to 50%) depending on course delivery mode (teaching center (ground) or virtual classrooms (online)). During the first year of online evaluations, incentives were offered (gift cards, iPods, GPS, etc) and heavy advertising took place. With budget constraints, incentives were discontinued and advertising tapered off. <br><br>
									One year out, our residential campuses response rates began to decline (53% and 57% respectively) as did response rates for our Worldwide campuses (25-30% ground, 45-50% online). At this time we re-evaluated our course evaluation system and moved to a system that had more flexibility in reports and administrative tools and a more user friendly dashboard. Fall 2009 online evaluations had their own challenges – the rollout of a new vendor system, retraining of faculty to the new system and bad timing of a new email system to the entire student body. Response rates plummeted to an unacceptable level of 30% & 50% for our residential campuses.

		<dt>I am unable to download reports in EvaluationKIT.<br />
			I am having problems viewing my EvaluationKIT dashboard. </dt>
        <dd>There are several things you can try:<br />
        <ul>
			<li>If you are using Internet Explorer, try <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">Mozilla Firefox</a></li>

        <dt>What are the benefits of the online course evaluation system? </dt>
        <dd><ul>
		<li>We will save over 150,000 pieces of paper each year. </li>
		<li>Students have more time to complete thoughtful responses and provide meaningful comments. </li>
		<li>Faculty will no longer have to take class time to allow students an opportunity to complete their evaluations. </li>
		<li>Faculty will receive summary reports, including student comments, much more quickly. Reports can be distributed shortly after grades are submitted. </li>
		<li>Faculty will be able to easily create custom longitudinal reports for performance review and tenure package. </li>
		</ul>
		</dd>
        <dt>What should I tell my students about the online course evaluation system? </dt>
        <dd>The most important way to ensure a good response rate and receive thoughtful feedback from students is to communicate the importance of course evaluations to the success of our academic programs.  Faculty can stress the various ways of accessing evaluations (Blackboard, Email link, and Mobile Devices) and how they have used results of past evaluations to enhance their course and/or teaching skills.  Please encourage your students to complete their online evaluations.  </dd>
		<dt>How do I increase my response rates? </dt>
        <dd>There are numerous ways to increase your response rates. 
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Encourage your students to complete the evaluations</strong>Students need to know that you value their input and that completing the evaluations is worth their time. </li>
		<li><strong>Let students know they can access their evaluations by: </strong>
		<ul>
		<li>Signing onto Blackboard, clicking on their “My Courses” tab and clicking on the link in “EvaluationKIT Course Evaluations” module</li>
		<li>In Ernie, clicking on their “Student Services” tab and then clicking on the End of Course Evaluation link</li>
		<li>In their course in Blackboard, click on Course Tools, then on the EvaluationKIT User Access</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>In their course in Blackboard, click on Course Tools, then on the EvaluationKIT User Access</li>
		<li><strong>Check your response rates </strong>by following the access instructions listed above. You will be able to see your response rates for each class. If you have more than 4 respondents, you are able to download a list of non-respondents for personal follow-up. Note: The list ONLY contains: Course ID, Student first and last name, email, ERNIE user ID, Student ID and Submit date. No data is associated with this list.  </li>
		</ul>
		 </dd>
		 <dt>Can faculty ask additional questions on the evaluations? </dt>
		 <dd>Yes. Custom questions open for chairs and faculty approximately 10 days before the evaluations open for the students. Questions must be uploaded the day before the survey opens. You can add up to 5 questions to each of your course evaluations. If you need assistance in creating questions, please email <a href="mailto:eraueval@erau.edu">eraueval@erau.edu</a>.</dd>
		 <dt>How will I know when my evaluation results are available? </dt>
		 <dd>Faculty will receive an email from <a href="mailto:ERAUEval@evaluationkit.com">ERAUEval@evaluationkit.com</a> indicating that the results are available. </dd>
		 <dt>How do I save a copy of my course evaluation results? </dt>
		 <dd>When they become available, results may be downloaded as a PDF or Excel file. </dd>
		 <dt>Can I see my results from past semesters? </dt>
		 <dd>Results from Spring 2009 forward is available in your EvaluationKIT dashboard. </dd>
		 <dt>Who will have access to the results of my course evaluations? </dt>
		 <dd>The results are available to you, your department head, and the college Dean. If you teach a course at a regional campus, your regional campus director will receive the results for the courses you teach at that campus. </dd>
		 <dt>What if I am an instructor and  I am taking courses? </dt>
		 <dd>In this scenario, you can view response rates as an instructor and submit evaluations if you are also taking courses. When you navigate to your EvaluationKIT dashboard, you are automatically signed in at your highest access level. After logging into the EvaluationKIT system, you will need to change your current role by clicking on the dropdown section beside your name. In the example below, the current role is “instructor”. In order to modify the role to “student”, click the dropdown and select “student/respondent”. 
			 You should now view any evaluations you have pending as a student/respondent. Once you have completed any evaluations, simply modify your role to “instructor” again to view course response rates for any courses you are teaching. 
		</dd>
		<dt>Who do I contact if I have more questions about the process or if I have difficulty accessing my response rates or results? </dt>
		<dd>Please contact the Office of Institutional Research at <a href="mailto:eraueval@erau.edu">eraueval@erau.edu </a> or 386-226-6225. </dd>
