<h1>ERAU Data (Fact Book)</h1>
<p>The Fact Book has been developed to provide an easy-to-use, electronic source of information about the University. Although not exhaustive, the Fact Book includes longitudinal information which is often requested of the Office of Institutional Research. Primary emphasis has been given to student-related information. Whenever possible, several years of information and/or graphical depictions have been provided to facilitate comparisons over time. The menus on the left will take you to the individual pages developed for that category.</p>

<p>Institutional Research is transitioning to a newly designed Fact Book which is much more comprehensive and includes interactive graphs.</p>

<p>Also, a data warehouse is being built which will allow you to "slice and dice" or query the data based on a number of different variables. The access to the data warehouse is only for inside university community and requires ERNIE login. More information:</p>
<p>To login to the system will require your Ernie Login and Password. The Oracle Discoverer reporting tool provides these features:
<ul>
<li>See trends over the past 10 years</li>
<li>Drill down to more variables: Click on triangles and Drill to Related variables</li>
<li>Export the data in various formats such as Excel, PDF, etc.</li></ul></p>
