You, $input{'name'}, whose favorite color is $input{'color'} are on a
quest which is $input{'quest'}, and are looking for the weight of an
$input{'swallow'} swallow.  And this is what you have to say for
yourself:<P> $text<P>

ENDOFTEXT


  # If you want, just print out a list of all of the variables.
  print "<HR>And here is a list of the variables you entered...<P>";
  print &PrintVariables(*input);

  # Close the document cleanly.
  print &HtmlBot;
}


sub PrintForm {

  print &PrintHeader;
  print &HtmlTop ("A simple combined form example");


  # Print out the body of the form from a single quoted here-document
  # Note that if ENDOFTEXT weren't surrounded by single quotes,
  # it would be necessary to be more careful with the other text
  # For example, the @ sign (in the address) would need to be escaped as \@
  print <<'ENDOFTEXT';

This is a sample form which demonstrates the use of
 the <B><A HREF="cgi-lib.pl">cgi-lib.pl</A></B> library of
routines for both generating a form &amp; processing its input.
