          <H2>EMPLOYER FEEDBACK SURVEY<br>
            (Daytona Beach, Prescott, & Extended Campus)<br>
          </H2>
        </div>
        <p> <b>DESCRIPTION:</b><br>
          Administered to employers of recent graduates. Gathers supervisors' 
          opinions on the graduates' overall performance, the usefulness of general 
          and degree-specific skills, and the graduates' level of competence at 
          those skills compared to graduates from other institutions. The list 
          of employers for the survey is generated from responses to the Alumni 
          Survey. <br>
          <br>
          <b>TIMELINE:</b><BR>
          The administration method has varied with regard to the length of time 
          since graduation.  Currently, employers of alumni are surveyed 1 1/2 years after the alumnus 
          graduated from the Daytona Beach Campus, Prescott Campus, or Extended Campus (including 
          Distance Learning). Prior administrations of the Employer Feedback Survey ranged 
          from two to five years after graduation.<BR><br>
