The University continually seeks to improve upon the quality of the education
provided to our students. Realizing that the delivery of such excellence is through
our faculty and staff, we have created a particular objective within the Vision 2010
plan focusing on our workplace environment. Your role within the institution provides
an integral part of our overall efforts to achieve success as an organization.<br>
<br>
A climate survey has been prepared for the purpose of seeking feedback from you on a
number of key indicators. your responses will allow us to better understand our working
environment and gain measures of faculty and staff satisfaction. Assessing the health of
the organization is among the many measures we need to collect as we follow our strategic
plan.<br><br>
We have developed this climate survey as a web-based instrument. This allows you the
opportunity to respond to the questions in both an easy and confidential way. Your
information will go directly to our Institutional Research office where all
responses will be aggregated and compiled, and a summary report developed. Individual
responses to the survey cannot be identified and confidentiality of your responses is
assured.<br><br>
Perhaps most important to this survey activity is what one does with the information.
I assure you that we are very interested to hear what you have to tell us. 
Once we have your feedback, we will determine what actions might be required or processes
improved. The credibility of this project rests on our ability to let you know we heard
you and are responding in some fashion.
<br><br>
So I encourage you to participate in this climate survey and give us the feedback we
seek. Your involvement in this process can only serve to strengthen our
organization. Thank you very much.

Dr. Barry Benedict<br><br><br>
