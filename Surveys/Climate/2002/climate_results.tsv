There continues to be a lot of rhetoric about becoming a more traditional university      yet we continue to maintain the status quo of 15 years ago.  A great deal of effort and money goes into talking about new initiatives      new curricula      and new directions for the university      but I have yet to see any progress.                    If the University administration really doesn't support ERAU becoming a more traditional university      then the administration should stop talking as though it does.  Accept the fact that we're primarily a technical institution where faculty scholarship and diverse curricula are not valued      and stop whetting people's appetites for a vision that is not going to be realized.                    We really are the world's number one aeronautical University.  Let's be proud of that and build on that strength.

The University administration      however      is based in Daytona and makes decisions which affect the climate at Prescott without input from individuals outside of Daytona Beach.  Prescott is understaffed      uses obsolete facilities      and does not seem to be on the radar for improvements while new buildings and positions continue to be added at Daytona Beach.

There is a consistent level of mistrust and poltical "back biting" that I see every day in my department      which is tremendous drain on resources and stifles effectiveness.  Resources to perform a job are haphazardly distributed and management decisions are made in a "let's throw it up on the wall and see what sticks" approach.  Essentially      the department and the underlying attitudes are very dysfunctional.  Behavior like kissing up to the boss and constant self-promotion are encouraged in this environment while anyone that brings a differing opinion      comment or otherwise dose of realism is labelled as not a "team player".                      I think there needs to be shift in attitude for the university as a whole to customer service.  The fact is      you never hear it mentioned and students rarely experience it during their time at Embry-Riddle.  Ask the majority of alumni      why they do not give back to the university and I think you will find that poor customer service skills are a root cause.  Let's face it      the students make everything possible      without them there would be no reason for us to be here.

However      in re. to benefits specifically      I have heard many complaints about Florida Health Care and am disappointed that the University does not look into other HMO options.  If they did      I would love to switch to the HMO.                    In regard to #15      reverse discrimination can also be an issue.  I strongly feel that that person having the best qualifications for a position should receive the position/promotion      etc. Definitely not based on sex or race.                    In re. to #18      although I feel that there is a lack of trust between the staff and different departments      I do not get involved and therefore      my answer to #19 is very satisfied.

Seeing a female VP in the picture is a big push for progress -- as there are many women on this campus who are just as qualified or moreso than many of the men for higher positions within the university.

THere is not enough office space for faculty and staff yet they take a classroom and turn it into a lab for graduate students.  We have staff members working in makeshift cubicles in an area of our safety center that was meant to be a library.                    I don't think grad students need to be pampered and given a lab with a couch to sit in while not in class.  Why can't they use the library to study or have group meetings along with the computer there instead of having things handed to them on a silver platter.                    The space they occupy could be used to house the staff members that are in the library trying to work in a noise environment.

Or an aspect of strategic planning?  The verbiage in Q 11 and Q 12 needs clarification.                    2. We don't receive enough notification of news-worthy university issues      events      etc.  I would rather hear about bad--or good--news from the university leadership than read about it in the local newspapers.  As a member of ERAU      I don't want to be treated like the general public when it comes to news about ERAU.                    3.  Many on campus are aware of the very selective perks provided to the highest officers.  When significant sums of university money are spent on privileges and questionable expenses for a very select few      the overall university community receives a very clear message.

In some instances      grassroots planning is edited and changed      in spirit and detail      at the level of departmental leadership.  And some planning has been so perfunctory that it has not even involved the faculty.  So      there is a definite difference between what is and what ought to be at ERAU.                    Also      I think we need to work at reducing red tape at ERAU      something we might accomplish if we also address administrative bloat in more general terms.  And red tape is a pervasive problem.

Where is HR in all this? Can't they recognize and stand up for these women and others like them who are being treated shabbily? Why does Embry-Riddle always kill the goose that lays the golden egg?

In view of this      you may wish to disqualify my survey (and I would not blame you) due to the extenuating circumstances pertaining specifically to CATER.

Policies and procedures have changed so often and so fast over the last few years that I no longer feel sure of what I am doing and have to look up an answer to any question or call someone.                    Since we started the mini-worldwides there has been less communications on policy changes to the field. It seems that the Daytona Beach staff and faculty feel they do not need to send out information since they pass it out at the mini-worldwides      but only a handfull of people get the word.                    I think the university is far behind in using technology in providing courses to the field.                     There seems to be little to no emphasis      or money spent      on marketing programs at the centers.                     I feel that each change that is made is geared toward closing down the centers and going to distance learning completely.                    The pay and benefits of the university are outstanding      but anyone who understands organizational behavoir would know that pay is not normally what motivates people to work. Most people desire a good working atmospher      recognition for work done well      and input to the changes made in the organization (having a voice). This university does not seem to want to listen to the people doing the day-to-day job of making this university great      but rather dictate changes and policy. I spent many years in the military and I have never know a good organizaiton where the Commander based all decisions on what he thought was best.                     All of that being said      I feel this is a great University and I am proud to be a staff/faculty member and graduate. Just like everything else in life there is always room for improvement.

Of course      you need to ask questions that beg answers from          issues that have been expressed from these groups.                    Assessment is only as good as the reason for it being presented: is there a problem      has the success of the mission been threatened because of certain issues.  Holding surveys every two years keeps track of changes that may be occurring as staffs changes      and the university grows.                    We may also want to consider specific surveys: Target a survey to address issues involving resources and information (communication)      and the mechanism that may obstruct these environmental aspects.  Or we could develop an assessment tool that will reflect a true and honest gauge of the current staff work environment at the Daytona Beach Campus.

The backgrounds and talents are so diversified that some of the employees' talents can be harnessed for the good of the Unviversity. For example      CDs can be effective seminar presentors at the WWC. Some of them may have backgrounds in marketing      public relations      international relations etc. They perspecties can be tailored to help problem solve generic issues relative to EC.                    I think sometimes the assumption is that an employees' longevity equates to no future goals or aspirations. And loyalty only goes so far when you feel you (and your work load)are taken for granted. Veteran employees have points of reference that's invaluable      especially in counseling students and performing evaluations.

There are quite a few departments on this campus where there          is negativity      unhelpfulness      and distrust.  A lot could be done to improve the delivery of services to students and to promote professionalism between staff members.                      I am not sure exactly what strides have been made toward hiring women and minorities      but have found this campus (and I've worked at two other universities over a ten year period)          to have a very sexist atmosphere.  I have been called a secretary repeatedly since I've been here without anyone considering the possibility that I MIGHT be something else (which I am).  The fact that faculty and staff alike have this mindset      shows that there is a long way to go in reducing sexism at ERAU.

The University has bene good to me. My son received an education from ERAU and I consider that a great benefit.  I don't think there could be a better place to work.  I do not believe      however      that many of the staff share my beliefs.  There is a great deal of mistrust among both the faculty and staff of the administration.                      For the most part I believe that the upper administration does a great job      given the constraints within which they must operate.  I do not      however      believe that the President has the good of the University at heart.  He spends too much time and money on unnecessary "frivolities" such as private planes and golf trips.  We also appear to be putting too much money towards development without seeing any results. But we have lived through difficult times before and I believe that this too shall pass.                    For the most part      I believe that everyone at the University works hard and does a great job - and we have a super group of students - outstanding young men and women who will do wellin life.

I appreciate a climate survey and the opportunity to make a few comments.                    1)There is a lot of litter on the campus grounds      particularly in the canal. Perhaps a student organization      if asked      will take a community service role and supplement the work of the grounds staff.                    2)The UC cafeteria tables and chairs      including staff dining      need more housekeeping attention than they're currently getting. Where to sit becomes a choice of lesser of two evils.  Outside there are broken Pepsi umbrellas which have been in a pile by the fence for a year.  Whose responsibility is it for removing these umbrellas?                      3)I would like to see my department spend some of its budget on ergonomic chairs and computer work stations.                    4)I would like the University to take the issue of parking for  staff and faculty seriously.  Employees who leave campus during the lunch hour should not have to be concerned whether a space will be open for their car when they return in less than an hour.                      5)I would like to see Christmas with Santa for children moved to a later hour (6:00 p.m.) or to a Saturday. I find it discriminatory that some employees are allowed two hours off without a charge to their personal leave while others without children      or with older children      must work and not receive equal time off.                    6)I would like the University to plan an off-campus Christmas party this year.

But too much work      not enough manpower (and hence time)      and too much emphasis on enrollments as a measure of productivity can eventually lead to frustrated staff in the field. Recommend you use University and Regional Audit performances and results as measures of a center's productivity in addition to enrollments. After all      is a center with high enrollments but poor administration compliance better than a center with average enrollments but superior administration compliance? The "university" can't have it's cake and eat it too. The feeling in the "weeds" is we are always the last to see any improvements to help us do our job      and we are on the "front line" each day. We go to conferences and are told of all the things that are or will be done to help us then months later see very little materialization of these promises.                    The university is a great place to work      has a terriffic mission      and superb people to work with. A little more help in the field and a little less emphasis on "enrollments" might go a long way to being a more profitable organization in the long-term.

I believe since Peter Quigley has left the Dean of Academics position      the faculty at Prescott will gain more confidence in their academic leadership.

I'm an engineering faculty and believe our new Dean of the College of Engineering (Don) is headed in the right direction.

Our salaries have little more than kept pace with inflation since Dr. Ebbs began his PR campaign. Everyone that works at this university has witnessed the free flow of money that seems to only gets damned up in payroll. Dr. Ebbs has been quoted on many occasion that the university depends too heavily on student tuition yet it has skyrocketed since he has come aboard. I wish we were getting the same slice of that tuition pie as we did under Sliwa. The atmosphere is excellent here and the benefits are good      but our wages are suffocating.

Moreover      I haven't seen any concerted attempts to increase underrepresented among administration or the BOT's.           Effective communication remains a significant problem between faculties at the different campuses. The DB faculty appears to provide little regard to the opinions of the LESSER GROUP found in Prescott.           A need exists to faciliate real communication between lead administration and faculty - more than informational meetings where administrators let us know what is going on and respond to questions.

While I may have some confidence in the new CAO and Chancellor      I have no confidence in the President      and other V-P's.  It seems the more you screw-up around here you are never fired      but given another job.  Just look at some of the former V-P's or Directors who seem to have been laterally moved instead of released.                              I will be surprised if these numbers are ever reported in a manner in which independent (non-administrative) personnel  can examine and interpret.                     In three years I have yet to hear Dr. Ebb's himself define what is meant by "One University"  He is the President of the organization but cannot define his own strategy.                    Spending is not student foused or academic focused      but seems to be guided by what is best for the administration and the priority of two offices: The President & Institutional Development.

In one year      Beth created and completed more tools to support EC field marketing than had been done in combined years past.  IT HAS BEEN A HINDRANCE FOR THE EC FIELD TO LOSE SUCH A VALUABLE POSITION AND I FEEL IT IS A GREAT INJUSTICE TO THE EC FIELD NOT TO HAVE SUCH SUPPORT.   Once again      we are left with a vacant position.  I strongly feel that there needs to be a greater initiative to do more 'mass advertising' and sharing of EC field marketing efforts. For instance      if a center in Washington has a successful relationship with 'Company Q' and is able to offer a program      certificate      or series of courses that meets the needs of their employees; then how would a center in Kansas      where 'Company Q' also has a location      know about such a success?  There is a lack of sharing of information across the EC field. Along the same line of thought      has there been a center that has creatively and successfully marketed a degree program      certificate      or series of courses to a small      medium or large sized airport?  What center isn't located near an airport?  How great would it be to learn what others are doing.... let's hear about those success stories!  Has any center been able to market the logistics certificate within the wharehouse distribution arena?  We need a sort of network or source point that would facilitate a sharing of marketing ideas.

2	1	1	3	3	2	1	1	2	2	3	3	2	3	3	2	2	2	2	3	2	2	4	1	1	2	WITH the increased ability of regional academic advisors and others to communicate via E-mail with all faculty and staff      there seems to be a tendency to "broadcast" a lot of information in piecemeal fashion      often to persons not really needing specific info.                      This is especially critical with personnel matters      where performance and personal comments are often CC'd to persons not known by the intended addressee      who must then ask:  "Who got this and what must I now do regarding them?"  To all but the originator      the message goes unanswered      with the implication to CCs that it is complete and true      or that the recipient didn't choose to respond.                      When each new message asks for responses and/or actions      it generates yet another widening array of addressees and CCs      to the extent that the original intent of messages is either lost or buried under a lot of other such material.  It's difficult sometimes to tell whether you are receiving something you must act on      or just another CC copy.                    All of this is simply an unintended effect of our ability to communicate.  It's now time to avoid this effect before it makes the system less useful.                    The solution should include more careful distribution of messages by all parties      as well as a policy that makes this very clear and understandable.  Persons who send out a lot of response-required messages ought to use a more vivid message ID that makes it clear that a response is requested/required.           Finally      we all ought to use some kind of personal message control system that shows when specific messages went out and what responses have been received. Most of us have far too many items in our "messages you've received" file to be able to go back and recheck each one; it will require a separate control      either electronic or paper.

However      it is hard for some staff and faculty to realize the importance of learning outside of the classroom.  Activities to keep the students active and involved must be present at ERAU.  Athletic      intramural      recreational      clubs      residence halls      etc.... must be addressed to improve the quality of life for the students.                      Why?  The students are the next alumni.  We need to treat the students with respect      care      and concern while they are here.  If we don't      they will not donate back to ERAU.  I can't believe a university with as much influence in the airline industry has an alumni giving rate of 4%.  We need to address that and soon.

I do not see the value added to the organization and I see a huge drain on our valuable resources. I also do not believe the President wants to be involved with the faculty      nor do I believe that he understands the roles of faculty within universities today. I think much needs to be done in this area. I do not have the confidence in this area that I believe should be there      but maybe time and a huge improvement of communication will change  my opinion      but typically when the high level person protects himself from the organization with that many layers      he is not interested in changing.

To achieve this potential      there needs to a better sense of "one-university" with more support for the president's direction and 2010 plan.          The University needs to assess the areas where there is low return eliminate those programs and invest that funding in strategic priorities.  There are too many low performers/weak departments or programs who are allowed to hang on while many are busting their butts to get their work done and make ERAU a better place.          Benefits for faculty/staff need to be analyzed and perhaps a "menu of options" should be offerred with more individual preference and choice due to individual situations -- ie give a dollar amount and let employees choose; some may want more health care      some more insurance      some more vacation or more retirement due to children or family circumstances.          The University needs to upgrade the services to students for the new tuition they are paying.          Faculty need to get into the modern world and begin to improve their teaching and use of technology.  To do this      the University needs to develop a better program for support of faculty and more resources dedicated to academic support and technology.

The actual result of implementation and application  is somewhat biased by the directors who hold power over regions. Pay is still held hostage by the powers to be and favored instructors are given higher percentage of pay. The pay directives do not give this type of direction. Benefits are non-existant for part-time faculty. Long term part time faculty should at least be recognized for longevity. There are very few minorities at the management level of the university.

We are working far too hard for far too little pay      and continue to do so out of dedication to the philosophical content of our jobs.  But there is a limit to everything.  We haven't had a significant pay raise in many years (greater than CPI increase) despite the tuition increases.

As for pay      with my education I would be payed significantly more in private industry.  Nevertheless      ERAU affords me the opportunity to enjoy myself in a challenging role.  Now the question is whether I am willing to relocate geographically to attain a higher salary rate?  Being the head of a young family with a single income is difficult indeed.  I would state that if salary does not continue to keep pace with the COLA/ inflation/ our peers      then yes      I would say goodbye to the job I LOVE to be a better provider.  I reason that I have a few years until I will have to make that decision.                      This survey instrument is flawed as I am free to sumit multiple surveys thus skewing the results.

4	2	3	4	2	1	1	4	2	2	2	2	2	2	4	2	3	4	3	1	2	2	2	1	1	1	I have some concerns about the lack of proactive measures being taken to recruit and retain female faculty and staff      as well as the lack of promotion of (primarily staff) women in the workplace.  It is generally believed that      in some recent staff hirings at Prescott (the Assistant to Chancellor position and the Summer Programs position)      two qualified women were by-passed by two lesser qualified men due to gender or nepotism. Of particular concern was the fact that one of the men selected was the Chancellor's brother-in-law      reportedly at a salary level far about the amount advertised. Further      the "resignation" of Peter Quickly as Dean of Academics was a tremendous blow to many on campus including faculty      staff and students. His progressive work had resulted - almost single-handedly - in the beginning of true diversification of the Prescott campus. It is now perceived that he was asked to step down from the Dean of Academics role because of his progressive nature      vocal support for diversity      and his support for non-traditional program initiatives. The forced resignation of Dean Quigley sent a signal to all that      despite his compelling support of the 2010 vision and strategic mission which calls for diversity and non-traditional programs      there remains a strong undercurrent of "traditional" resistance to change that will ultimately prevent 2010 vision from coming to fruition. Those whom Dean Quigley recruited within an active plan of increasing diversity feel almost abandoned by the current administration due to the non-support of Dean Quigley. Many perceive the current Prescott leadership intends to stall or even reverse the diversity progress made over the past 4-5 years. Some non-traditional non-tenure faculty in underrepresented groups actually fear they have no future at Embry Riddle. Female and minority students continually and openly express concerns over the disparate gender and race "ratios" at ERAU.  As such      active steps need to be taken to address this concern or the University will potentially lose the progress made in recruiting and retaining those under-represented groups in the student population and within the faculty. Thanks for the opportunity to share these concerns in a confidential manner. I truly want the best for the University and its students      and hope these matters will be constructively addressed by University Administration.

There are great inequities in resource allocation      despite Prescott having higher student satisfaction and lower attrition rates.  But      in the past year these issues have at least been addressed      which is a good sign.

But it is still hard to see the connection between the time involved and the reward.                    After being here for more then two years I have not seen any hiring that promotes women or supports diversity on campus. I have seen the opposite.  Internal promotions without a search      men who are friends people being hired      hiring people who are limited or no experience for the position.  Qualified women candidates being over looked to for no known reason.                    I also feel the Prescott Campus has a sad hiring record this year. The only women who were hired in leadership roles were last choices or were promotions of women without experience.  The old boys network is stronger then ever.  Please look at the hiring history for 2001 and 2002.  Start with the Development department and go from there.                    The University has a non discrimination policy for sexual identity but promotes and accepts gay bashing and gay hating attitudes on campus.                    There is a long way to go.

4	1	2	3	2	2	2	5	4	4	4	4	4	2	5	3	5	4	3	1	1	3	2	2	1	1	I often face discrimination and harassment as a woman at Prescott.  I do not believe that university leaders are truly interested in advancing women and minorities on the Prescott campus.  They pay lip service to these issues - but when hiring decisions are made      white men are clearly favored.                      I never thought I would face discrimination and harassment on a daily basis in the workplace.  While not completely overt and easily reportable      this harassment and discrimination creates a very chilly climate.  I am not given the same respect      attention      and opportunity as my male colleagues.                    I hear women faculty and staff talk about their fear to come forward with harassment and discrimination complaints because of the fear of retaliation.  Women also do not want to be part of any advocacy for change due to fear of losing their opportunity for tenure or losing their job.                    I also hear comments by faculty and staff that show the chilly climate for people of color and gay      lesbian and bisexual people.  I am often shocked that faculty and staff feel it is okay to make statements that alienate these people.  Faculty and staff need to be supportive of all students and all employees - regardless of color or sexual orientation.  I am often uncomfortable on campus because of these issues.                    I feel the situation has worsened since our current leadership has taken over the campus.  President Ebbs and Dr. Benedict did not even give this campus a chance to participate in the search for our leader.  Electing not to have a search process for the chancellor or other leadership positions on our campus has increased the perception that this campus is an "old boys network" and has left out the possibility of hiring women or people of color in leadership positions.  Our Chancellor's behavior since his tenure as interim chancellor      then chancellor      has worsened the atmosphere on this campus.                     I continue to work at ERAU because I live in Prescott and plan to stay.  While my work is satisfying and I feel that I am growing professionally      this institution is less than ideal for me and I would work elsewhere if given the opportunity in Prescott.

Women are passed by      even when more qualified than a male candidate      for staff and faculty positions.  Nepotism and the "good old boy" rules are alive and well on the Precsott Campus...from the TOP on down.  Search committees seem to be a waste of time for committee members as candidates are "pre-selected" before interviews even take place.  Even though campus diversity and university diversity committees exist      they are just one more committee where progress is not evident.  We      as employees      do not have a safe place to go when we feel discriminated against or treated unfairly without the threat of retaliation. ERAU policies and procedures      listed on the ERAU website      are not followed and I consider them to be ineffective.   I truly believe in Embry-Riddle's Strategic Plan Mission Statement and feel passionate about our wonderful students...who will some day be the leaders of tomorrow. How can we "teach" these young-adults diversity      fairness      and equity when our campus leadership does not exibit diversity      fairness and equity among its own staff and faculty.

There is too much disparity in the range of pay from the highest to the lowest employee  for the work load required. The low end of the pay scale is too low for seasoned and well qualified employees.                    The low pay does not provide much of an incentive for workers at all levels. ERAU is a wonderful University      and they need to take care of their "own people." As a result of the low pay      there is a high turn over rate.  The money is there; it just needs to be disbursed to the hard working staff and faculty.

Yet      a highly technical senior management staff poition pays 40K.  Who is fooling who here?  The band for my particular poisition reflects a wage range that is approximately 100% lower than the average           industry" figure for the same job.  Executive management needs to take a hard look at itself and what it's doing.  My case in point is the President's bungled state of the university presentation.  He couldn't even portray statistical and financial figures correctly from his own slides!  ERAU has come this far only because of the sacrifices made by it's hard working faculty and staff.

Compensation has long been regarded as insufficient and not even keeping pace with government published COL figures.                    Faculty should have some means of accessing their retirement funds at age 59.5 - w/o leaving the University.                    Regular and consistent assessment of classroom teaching effectivness is poor or non-existant for many      and perhaps most      faculty members.                    ERAU is a great place to work      but compensation issues have consistently caused it to lose numbers of fine      even exceptional      faculty members over the years.  If it were not for a number of fine administrators      and the unique      attractive environment of the Prescott area      this campus would have closed many years ago.

As a matter of fact I believe that we are missing out on prospective new students because we have eliminated some of the students who we used to welcome into our program.  I think that we need to take a serious look at the new (more strict) rules on who we can accept and the type of credits we are willing to allow as transfer credit in the TOS area of the degree.                      I also am seriously concerned about the new (much more stringent) qualification standards being used for new faculty. I am not advocating accepting unqualified faculty by any means but I do believe that we can be a little more flexible when it comes to the experience that we look for in new faculty who may not be terminally degreed.  In some cases and at some locations      especially small remote locations      I believe that the time is going to come when we will not have any faculty approved who can teach and as a result      we may have to seriously look at closing some locations.  The type of faculty that I am talking about are the ones at military locations who have extensive experience in the aircraft operations who should be able to teach some of our courses but because they do not meet the standards listed in the POM they are disapproved.

The air quality is so poor      employees are always sick.  The recycled air is filled with dust      mold and germs.  I suffer from headaches at least three times a week.  I have seen rodents in the ceiling lights.  When reported rat poison was placed in the ceiling tile.  A lot of good a box of rats poison will do in a rodent infested building.            It is hard working in cramped office conditions.  The make shift offices block out no noises; it is hard to carry on a conservation or to think.  The walls and ceilings are dingy yellow.  When SAC's came to visit the entire conference room was painted and pictures were hung. It looked really nice. It's sad that this was done not for the hardworking employees but to impress a group of people that used it for three days.                    I urge you to visit the Extended Campus to see the above first hand.                    It is disheartening that the Extended Campus      which brings in the most income for the university is treated like a dirty old shoe.

I have been successful in requesting MBA level textbooks for the MBAA courses I teach in most areas.  Several of the MBAA course textbooks are still "principles" textbooks.                    I teach 5 + courses in the MBAA curriculum each year and feel that the students at the Extended Campus sites do not have the prerequisites to appropriately allow me to require the depth of understanding that is usually required in a typical MBA curriculum.  My full-time position requires teaching the capstone undergraduate courses in Finance and MBA courses at an AACSB accredited university      conducting research      and providing service functions to various communities.  I see dramatic differences as to the preparation of the students in business between MBA courses offered on campus and through our Interactive Video Networking offerings and what ERAU requires of its MBAA students.  I have repeatedly commented to the Center Director about this matter but due to the need to maintain sufficient class sizes      many students are allowed to enroll and are totally unprepared to undertake graduate work in business.  As long as ERAU does not enforce "stringent" prerequisites in accounting      economics      finance      marketing      information systems      management      writing and communications      mathematics and statistics      and other foundation courses      the students will not achieve an appropriate level of understanding.  I have to spend precious class time and assign outside work to get students prepared for graduate level treatment of the MBA curriculum.  I believe the university must take a more aggressive stand in requiring appropriate undergraduate prerequisites.  Requiring a "general understanding of business" is a wholely inadequate prerequisite for the MBAA curriculum.

However      some things to consider:                    1) The university touts the importance of technology but is not willing to fully make a commitment to seeing advanced technologies on campus (time/money).                    2) Equity raises have barely kept up with inflation and have done little or nothing to reflect true skill sets of the employees.                    3) There are employees on campus that due to the nature of their jobs are not able to take advantage of their personal leave and when maxed out begin losing it.  An option to cash out a portion of our personal leave.  Here's an idea for options:          -you must have you disability maxed out before your can cash out any personal leave.          -you must have over 200 hours of personal before you can max out.  a graduated scale might work where if you have 200-209.99 hours you can cash out 40      210-219.99 you can cash out 50      220-229.99 cash out 60      230-239.99 cash out 70      and if you have 240 then you can cash out 80.          -you can can only take a cash out option once per year (must have at least 25 pay periods in between requests).          I've wanted to kick that idea out but never really had a forum for it.                    4) Would like to opportunity to get some specialized training that will enable me to perform better at my job and probably save the university money long term but am frequently told that this cannot be done because any training related to my job is usually out of state and we can't afford that.

Class size has steadily increased      and faculty hires has not nearly kept up the need.  There is still a considerable schism between older      teaching-oriented faculty and research faculty. In some departments      this has led to systematic abuse of newer faculty by the older      tenured faculty.  The administration has taken some steps towards remedying this      but still has far to go.                    The evaluation procedure still doesn't make much sense      and actually penalizes those who both teach a full load and do research.  Again      some progress may be in the offing on this issue.                      Expecting our faculty to compete in research with faculty at major state-supported institution is a dream      unless they are given a lot more support in terms of lowered teaching workload and internal research funding.

One who cooperates with other departments and/or other campuses is sometimes regarded as "swimming against the current" in that it is not the climate of the institution      despite the "one university" objective and the fact that we are all here to serve our customers      the students.

Most of us love the atmosphere in which we work and the interaction with students      faculty and staff      but that is being eroded by lack of positive change. I feel and see the following:                    The power trips displayed by some administrators and wasted money on efforts to "look" good rather than direct monies to needed improvements is appalling.                    Our vehicle fleet is an embarrassment. We start and stop building projects without dedicated funding or we attempt to move personnel into unfinished facilities hampering the efforts to complete renovations properly.                     Worst of all their seems to be a lack of recognition of the history of relationships with those that support      and those who have in the past supported the University financially by the very people who are responsible for obtaining that support. I know or have heard of benefactors who have discontinued their support for mere lack of contact and loss of the closeness once felt with our campus community.

The President      while saying the right things      does not have a good track record of following his words with actions and has been disengaged from the core mission of this University for too long.                    With respect to question 13. There is no clear set of guidance or process for budget allocations that is known by those who work here. If the process were known      and the overall budget picture could ever be presented in such an manner that can be understood      it would help alleviate misperceptions and misunderstandings. I would like to see what is allocated to each department on campus each year. This cannot be hard to do. Simply getting a list of departments by object code and total budget allocation should be easy to do. In an environment of trust and open communication      no one should feel threatened by this. Any questions about the allocation of the budget can be clarified to the understanding of all. Right now      my perception is one that things are trying to be hidden.                    With respect to question 14. There has been a lot of talk for the past three years about pay improvements. Only recently has any strong effort been made regarding faculty salaries. I think this is due to the efforts of the CAO. But      here it is 2002      and we are still talking about Comp 2000. My perception is that this is been delayed so the money can be spent elsewhere. Over the years      the trend has been to continually move pay increases back      delaying the University's obligation.                    With respect to question 18. Last year      I would have answered this with a strongly disagree. However      because of the efforts of the CAO      the past chancellor      and past academic dean      the concept of mutual trust seems to be returning. As far as I am concerned      the president seems to only listen to faculty when pushed to do so      as does the VP for Inst. Adv. The attitudes of the CAO      and from what I've observed      the new chancellor are a welcome change. I hope this trend continues. Trust and at the department and campus level academics has not been a problem. I think respect and trust among academic departments is improving. Trust and respect within my department are at very high levels.                    Finally      question 19. ERAU is the best at what we do      and working here is a distinct pleasure      in spite of the problems we are now trying to solve. This place is like a family.  It has been said by many that this institution is stronger than its leadership      and this I attribute to the character of the people and students who make this place happen      the ones in the trenches.

3	2	5	4	3	2	1	4	4	4	2	3	4	2	3	4	4	3	3	1	1	3	2	1	1	2	There have been numerous changes in administration.  I don't know how the current administration will act and thus don't have confidence in it      yet.  In my 12 years here we have had 7 chancellors and 9 Dept. Heads/College Deans.  Similarly      the organizational structure has changed numerous times.  It is my hope that we will retain the current structure and administration long enough to be able to make some progress toward their directions.  Similarly      the current strategic planning process is just beginning to take effect.  It is now tied to budgeting      which makes it worthwhile to perform.  Perhaps      if we stay the course long enough to get some progress      we will develop some confidence in the system.  The assessment process has no real incentives.  There should be some periodic program review that uses the assessment and evaluates programs based on the assessment.  You must do something about the workload.  Rewarding good teaching would be a first step.  We are a unique University.  We should have teaching tenure and research tenure.  I have seen lousy teachers      but good researchers tenured      and no good teachers      but lousy researchers tenured.  What would prevent having 1/2 tenured faculty be for research and 1/2 be for teaching.  Hope this helps.

I am disappointed to see many of our students who are struggling with their moral development negatively influenced by these activities. The activities include such things as Octoberwest (where alcoholic beverages are purchased by the unversity for our students)      Casino night      numerous sex speakers (who promote such sexual practices like homosexuality      masturbation      pornography      etc.)      etc. The Office of Student Activities has usurped great power promoting activities that many faculty feel are morally damaging. The faculty should help decide what types of activities will by sponsored by the university for our students' cultural and social development outside of the classroom.

																										I already submitted by survey      but I would be remiss if I didn't mention the need for an onsite daycare facility.  I am one of several parents who would like to see this implemented.  It has been discussed on a few occasions      but there was never support from the top to initiate such a program.  Not only would a daycare center provide peace of mind for the employees      but is a lucrative business to get involved in.  I pay roughly $800.00 per month for daycare for my two small children.  Please consider the suggestion and perhaps communicate this concern to the folks in Spruance Hall.

The leadership of this campus has totally failed to implement and manage the strategic plan. We dont know where we are or where we are going. When faculty ask in meetings about the plan      we are told to go look at the website!!!!!!! A plan should be a document that people understand      believe in and get rewarded for helping to accomplish. There is absolutely no leadership or direction in this campus on how to implement this plan. The campus does not know where we stand on program development      student enrollment      growth vs. no-growth      diversity      etc. In sum      right now the plan is meaningless to most faculty and staff. The overall sense is that if you do what you have been doing for the last 10 years (e.g.      teaching cut-and-dry boring math without causing too much trouble) your contract will be renewed and that is it!

There is no sense among families      students (potential or enrolled) that ERAU is a UNIVERSITY with a goal to educate the whole person. Most flight students behave as if this is a trade school. Most engineering students focus on a very narrow concept of aerospace industry. There is no academic culture that instills in students a sense of citizenship      social responsibility      and love for knowledge and understanding. The administration of this campus does not even encourage a larger view of education as their own background is in very narrow technical field.

It has been with optimism      I have expressed my desire to work as a department director to my supervisor      our dean and ultimately our chancellor.  Sadly      I have seen no evidence of improvement since the appointment of Dan Carrell as chancellor conversely     it appears to be moving backward.                    My experiences at Embry-Riddle are mixed.  Within my own department I feel my work is meaningful and appreciated. There is a high level of respect and collaboration.  At the higher levels of administration my experience has been just the opposite.                      I have had interaction with both our chancellor and with administration on the Daytona Beach campus that has been demeaning.  In the case of our chancellor      the one time I went to his office to ask for verbal support for a developing program that most consider to be vital to educational institutions      he essentially told me my job was not important to our campus or the university. This was said with his feet on his desk and the soles of his shoes in front of my face.                                During this meeting I also told him I had interviewed for an associate director position with the university but was offered the of job assistant director at a much lower salary. I told him I was discouraged by this appointment and felt more than qualified to serve as associate director.  He seemed apathetic regarding my position. Other interactions have been brief uncomfortable.                    Recently      a director position opened up on campus.  I was more than qualified for the position but chose not to pursue it because the salary posted was too low.  I have since learned that the person chosen (who seemed to have little background in this field) was given a substantially higher salary and a home on campus.  It is also rumored that this person is the chancellor's brother-in-law      and that other qualified individuals were overlooked in the hiring process.                    I perceive the overall morale on campus is exceedingly low among many groups.  Those of us in underrepresented groups on campus felt we had an advocate in Peter Quigley.  He was our only voice.  Since his "resignation" was announced I question whether someone of  my gender has an opportunity to be promoted.I have grown to care deeply about this university and its remarkable students.  There are many talented      dedicated individuals on this campus I respect and enjoy working with.  Sadly      many of them are planning to leave due to the unbearable situation...People are not treated as valuable resources for the campus.                     It is with some hope for positive change      I write this letter. I realize many will recognize me through the circumstances I decribe.  I have risked expressing my experiences and discontent in order to somehow implement change.

Faculty members who conduct funded research have to constantly justify their out-of-classroom time to faculty and students. There is no nurturing of research or scholarship careers here. The chancellor has never articulated a vision for research or scholarship. His own background      lacking a doctoral degree and research experience      could be the problem.                    What happened to a commitment to diversity? Female faculty have been seriously discriminated against in promotion and job placement. The Chancellor recently appointed his brother-in-law to a position for which competent women applied. The search committee even recommended some of the female candidates over the Chancellors brother-in-law. There are no female faculty going up for promotion right now even though there are some very good candidates. Female students keep writing essays      for my class      where they describe horror stories about discrimination at the flight line. Sadly      they also know that there is no policy or mechanism to help them out. Most end up leaving ERAU altogether. There is no office or institutional commitment to address the needs or experiences of underrepresented groups.

MANY OF US DO HAVE SERIOUS DOUBT CONCERNING OUR SENIOR LEVEL MANAGEMENT      ALTHOUGH DR EBBS IS PROBABLY AN IMPROVEMENT OVER DR SLIWA.  IS OUR SENIOR LEVEL ADMINISTRATION IN TOUCH WITH HOW ERAU BECAME SO SUCCESSFUL (FLIGHT AND ENGINEERING)?  THERE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A LOSS OF FOCUS ON AVIATION AND AEROSPACE. WE HAVE BEEN SHIFTING OUR MISSION FROM A STRONGLY TEACHING BASED INSTITUTION AND ATTEMPTING TO EMULATE UNIVERSITIES THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH OUR AVIATION RELATED MISSION. THE RECENT EMPHASIS IN PROMOTION AND TENURE HAS BEEN "PUBLISH OR PERISH".  ATTEMPTS AT REVALUING TEACHING ARE OFTEN RESISTED BY RESEARCH ORIENTED FACULTY THAT ONLY LOOK AT TEACHING AS A NECESSARY EVIL OR AN ANNOYANCE OR A REQUIREMENT FOR MORE WORK.  RESEARCHERS WANT WORKLOAD REDUCTIONS BUT DO NOT WANT TO SUPPORT ALSO VALUING TEACHING (THEY NEED TO STOP WHINING).  THERE APPEARS TO BE A SIGNIFICANT LACK OF RESPECT FOR OUR LARGEST      MOST SUCCESFUL PROGRAM BECAUSE ITS FACULTY OFTEN DO NOT FIT CLASSICAL ACADEMIC MODELS. ALTHOUGH THIS DISREPECT OF AERONAUTICAL SCIENCE HAS EASED SOME WITH THE ADDITION OF DR. EBBS AND DR. BENEDICT      IT STILL PERSISTS. THE FACT THAT THE UNIVERSITY HAS GRADUALLY REPLACED EVERY UPPER LEVEL ADMINISTRATOR WITH INDIVIDUALS WITH LITTLE OR NO AVIATION EXPERIENCE HAS CONTRIBUTED TO OUR LOSS OF FOCUS AND MUCH DECREASED MORALE.  WE NEED TO PUT THE AERONAUTICAL BACK IN EMBRY RIDDLE.  IT IS TIME WE REKINDLE A DEGREE OF MUTUAL RESPECT BETWEEN TRADITIONAL ACADEMICS AND THOSE TEACHING IN LESS TRADITIONAL AREAS.  DANCE WITH WHO BROUGHT TO THE PARTY. COMMON SENSE?  MAKE GOOD USE OF EXISTING RESOURCES AND DON'T ASSUME THAT SOMEONE ELSE ALWAYS KNOWS HOW TO DO THINGS BETTER.  TOO MAY CONSULTANTS ARE USED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS WE COULD ANSWER OURSELVES. TRUST YOUR EMPLOYEES - IN TURN YOU WILL BE TRUSTED.  STOP SPENDING NON-ACADEMIC MONEY LIKE IT WAS COMING FROM A BOTTOMLESS PIT.  WE ALL LOVE THIS UNIVERSITY - DON'T SCREW IT UP.

Much of this is fomented by several members of the DB Business Department.

2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	2	3	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	4	1	2	2	In many of the ERAU academic areas      significant changes occur in relatively short periods of time.  Some examples are airlines      transportation      security operations and the state-of-the arts in science.   ERAU is remiss in not maintaining current films in the film library.  Specific areas are aircraft      spacecraft      sciences and air transportation systems.  Many of the textbooks recommended for use are outdated      as well.  An example is the recommended text for MAS603      "Future Flight: The Next Generation of Aircraft           Technology      1994      (Siuru & Busick/McGraw-Hill)".  Eight years is a long time without update for this subject.  If it were one of the math courses      using a book dated twice that long would probably be perfectly acceptable.  Course monitors      I assume are being paid to do something and I think keeping updated texts and materials should be a high priority.                    Perpetually changing mandatory syllabus templates are an unacceptable drain of time and effort.  I agree that some instructors were submitting some very shoddy products.  But      one would think that a major university could get it right with one or two versions... or 6 ... or 8 ...or....  Come on now.                    I commend ERAU for stressing the use of computers      classroom electronic projectors      modern electronics and communications.  However      I fault the same university for requiring hard copies of high and low grade papers and projects      rather than electronic copies.  In addition      the student registration process should capture student E-mail addresses.  Instructors should be encouraged to grade student papers      projects      and GRPs electronically      using "Track Changes" and electronic "Comments" features of the word processor      spreadsheet or graphic presentation media.                    Other than some of these frustrations      I thoroughly enjoy teaching for ERAU.  It is an outstanding educational institution and I am proud to be a part of it.

Many times information is broadcast through the news media that relates to ERAU      prior to the faculty and staff being informed about it.                      #04. For the most part      I feel my opinions count      but that is only when I am asked for it. There are times I feel certain topics will effect our work      but we are only asked to solve the problems the changes may cause      rather than foresee some obstacles and correct them PRIOR to implementing new procedures.  I am very open to change      but would like to be considered as a valuable resourse with an opinion. A good example of the above is the MRO certificate program.

There *are* ways to accomplish both.  It may be happening      but it's not obvious to this survey taker that it is.                    Benefits should be extended to domestic partners of unmarried employees.  That's only consistent with the university's statements regarding sexual orientation.  It shouldn't be a matter of having to be a terribly squeaky wheel to make this happen      just because it doesn't affect the bulk of employees.                    The questions of whether we're accomplishing something in all of teaching      research/scholarship      and service is loaded.  No one should want to admit they're not accomplishing what they're asked      but the reality is that we're asked to do too much in too little available time with too little support from above.  Something almost always has to give      and in most cases it's research.  I guess that's better than quality of teaching suffering      but there is still disagreement between expectations and the reality of what can be accomplished.                    Speaking of research      how about some overhead recovery to the departments so they can support research internally?  You know      like just about every other institution of higher education?                    And an intellectual-property policy?                    Bi-annual revision of the strategic plan is too short of a cycle      and the software system for doing so is lousy.  (It sucks.)  Would be better to get departments and university out of phase      so that departments work on their plan during      say      spring      and campuses and the university collates them together into one in fall.                    What budget model?                    Proposed web pages for the university do *not* look good      but it seems that no one higher up wants to hear that.  This is an example of how the university often spends its money on bad products or bad services.  We're often left with a "what were they thinking?" feeling when it comes to things like those proposed web pages.                    And web-based registration.  Web-based registration should be good      but there needs to be a way to let departments require face-to-face advising prior to registration.  How do these decisions get made?                      Sometimes      it's "is there nothing they can't be sold?"                    University should have an internal weekly or monthly publication for news and info: who won what award      who went to what conference      who got promoted      etc.                      Is there really going to be longer-term assessment activities?  Are the ones that have been instituted sustainable?                    Please take these as heartfelt suggestions      not generic griping.  This is a wonderful place to work      with wonderful people.  Most of us would like to continue here      working to improve what's a great place.

Many people are sick at the same time and it spreads very fast making me think the air is not as pure as it could be.

We know better and a suitable explaination of what goal or motivation of these changes should have been provided.  I no longer trust the current administration.  In particular      I doubt the Chancelor of the Prescott campus has the support of the students or faculty both because of his actions (or lack there of) and the way he was appointed.                    Chancelor Parlier built high expectations and hope on this campus      despite his many other faults.  President Ebbs' has furthered those expectations      but dampened the hope by tying our needs to the University and DB campus.  Chancelor Carrell provides no leadership at all - at best      he manages the campus to satisfy the Universities needs.                    We still produce a good product in our graduates and we have a good comraderie among the faculty.  Both will continue if the administration can support our needs which is considerable more than bricks and mortar (or talk thereof) or higher pay.  Stability      leadership      and freedom are in greater demand.

All we see is what comes via email and occasionally us mail. University priorities and strategic planning objectives are not well deciminated.

Employees who see ways to save money never see the change/nor hear about whether the suggestion has merit or worthless. There is no employee suggestion program. This is demoralizing. Every employee at Riddle knows some way to save $5.00 - but no one ever asks. If a great program were implemented university-wide      there would be lots of improvements/savings/new ways of thinking.                    Include part time employees in our department meetings - at least invite them or provide minutes.  We are not one team yet and a lot of time is spent trying to keep part timers up to speed on changes.  This is especially important to part time/adjunct faculty members who impact end product.                    Employee recognition program totally lacking.  when an employee publishes or does something to bring credit/recognition to the university      this individual should be acknowledged.

Jack Welch went out of his way to talk to the employees - that was how he learned - as he put it "talking off layers of clothing to determine what the real temperature".

David James (while he's now gone) and his "mentoring" program did much damage. Who was watching him? Why was he allowed to corner us like that?   He would approach staff members and ask      "what things do you think your boss could do better" under the guise of mentoring the individual.  This causes back stabbing      distrust/hate/discontent.  Who is HR???????? My orientation to ERAU was to sign benefit forms.  What happened to a "welcome to the organization".  There was none of that.  Does anyone in HR care?  who are they?  Low visibility of support teams is a problem at Riddle.                      We are taking bets on if feedback of surveys materialize - in the past      we've been quizzed - but no improvements/change.  Its time to change and GROW RIddle!

Our Center has done well all these years and exceptionally well the last few.  However      since I do not have a Masters I am at the top of the pay scale and am not entitled to any raises.  Why is there not a way to compensate longtime employees who get the job done? Since there is a Regional Manager with no Masters      why would my pay increase be tied to another degree when that persons isn't.                    I feel the people in the field are not taken seriously enough when it comes to University decisions.  It always seems to be about the campus - don't the people there realize if we did not exsist that they would not exsist?  If we are asked to be on committees      then let us know when meets are.  There have been a number of cases where people volunteer to be on one and then decisions are made and they are notified and never been to a meeting or contacted.

Conform to the view of the supervisor without the ability to initiate work flow improvements has been a problem.  In my opinion      supervisors should be required to attend workshops for creative team development skills on a periodic renewal basis.

For example      I am currently making less money per year than I made 10 years ago in another state in the same position.  The amount of personal leave here is very low compared to the other state I worked in.  We received 10 hours of vacation time and 8 hours of sick leave every month      including the first month of employment.  We were not allowed to use vacation time until a 6 month probationary period had been successfully passed (I think we should do that here)      but sick leave could be used when needed.  The total amount of personal leave staff receive the first year or so of employment is less than 8 hours per month total.  If you get sick      you can end up loosing pay.          I would also like to see a change on the health benefits plan so that we can mail order prescriptions from the Phoenix Walgrens instead of Florida.  It doesn't make sense to me why we can't since this service is available in Phoenix.  Also      Health care costs are rising so much      the annual exam always cost more here than the $200. allowed per year.          I also have not seen a significant number of women or minorities hired at high level positions on the Prescott Campus.

Center Directors have an enormous amount of responsibilities and should be adequately compensated for this      as should ACD's and faculty.  The Extended Campus contributes so much to ERAU and the success of each Center should continue to be rewarded. I believe that recognition of staff should occur at Worldwide Conferences.

No diversity committee recommendations have been implemented and when asked why not administration answers no budget. Improved hiring of underrepresented groups      improving success of underrespresented students has not occurred. No university resources allocated to improve this environment. Is this university an Equal Opportunity Employer?                     Campus climate          Unhealthy for women. Current chancellor has shown a pattern of discrimination against women      going so far as to hire his own brother-in-law over qualified female candidates who were recommended by hiring committee. No faith in current chancellor from female faculty.                    Campus has yet to implement a zero tolerance policy with regards to discrimination of people of color      women and gays and lesbians. Some male faculty continue to make derogatory remarks to students from underrepresented groups.                     Global initiatives          By far      faculty and students continue to remain parochial and narrow-minded about the fast-changing global economy which the university and its graduates must exist in. No commitment from administration to internationalize curriculum      foster international awareness among faculty      staff and students      and emphasize importance of international scholarship.                    Strategic Planning          A busy-work activity. Does not lead to new vision nor improved programming      professional development      or campus culture. Nor to new budget allocations to implement supposed outcomes of strategic plan. This university is without a mission.                    Professional development          Again      a weakness. Grant awards are very difficult when faculty cannot include cost sharing as university contribution. No commitment to research      new curricula      improved pedagogy. This faculty is very stagnant.

The faculty director      however      has been very supportive and professional. There seems to be no pay scale I can follow      and no reason for my rank.  I am very highly qualified yet I was ranked asst. professor when I began with no explanation.  I felt strongly that a man with my qualifications (doctorate and 17 years of experience as an adjunct with many awards) would have been given the rank of adjunct asso. professor.  I consistently get outstanding evaluations      but they seem to make no difference in either pay or ranking      which is disappointing.  If ERAU really wants more women and minorities      it needs to improve communication with these individuals      treat them with respect      and creat a clearly defined pay scale and ranking structure.

While there are policies on file about development      no one uses HR except to hire/fire.  No trust in HR. No training programs and the ones that are offered want $$$$. We have internal talent and could provide great training programs by sharing talent      Intellectual knowledge sharing is a big issue in corporate world per industry relations committee members.                    2.  High employee turnover which does impact finished products.  Students are talking.  It is not so much pay issues - we are distrustful      are not included in decision making - lack of personal development.                    3.  Grievances should be benchmarked and it should be determined what common problems are.                    4.  There are barriers to making contributions at Riddle. No program      no action.  I heard some Riddle adjunct over in Humanities or business published in some publication on how to develop such an internal program - yet we ignore our own talent.                     5.  Why isn't there a distinguished employee program?  There's a staff/faculty appreciation which is nothing more than a "halo effect" system and a joke within our ranks.  Students are "asked" to nominate individuals for recent contributions.  Change the timing of the award and see the differences or reword the award so that the student nominates an individual for ongoing activities - not just at the end of the term when a professor coaches them on a test or the student gets a resume.  Current program is demoralizing.                    6.  Adhere to policies that are in writing.  Big inconsistency. Do we ever update policies or just change the date on them?????                     7.  Realizing there is a new group leading      we are watching      hoping but have been down this road many times with initial efforts that look promising only to be left with false hope.  Many are not participating to this survey due to lack of trust of past ERAU staff members hollow words.                    8.  Why does the senior staff spend so much money in travel (6-8???) went to the Paris air show when we are still using blackboards in the classroom?  Why do so many go to NBAA?  Why did Pres go to Hawaii for one week? Exactly what was the gains from all of this?  Faculty feel there is tooo much wining/dining when we are using bare bones equipment/systems.  If we had better equipment      then our students might market us themselves.                      9.  Too many students complaining about the 4 hour flight block and there's some flight schools near by that are taking this weakness and using to their advantage.  new flight school under construction this very minute with some great strategic plans. Soon we will not be the only show in town.                    10. This isn't the first audit.  However      my hope is this will be the first audit that we get to see the results.   Demoralizing to fill out audits only to never hear summary or plans of action to correct.                    Think more of your faculty - we appear to be second class citizens at Riddle as demonstrated by our lack of space      our outdated classroom equipment      our involvement with decisions being made      by your lack of presence in our classrooms.  how can you possibly know what is going on holed up in Spruance or in Paris. Best learn about Riddle first. 	Climate	3.00.63	Mon Feb 10 2002 07:32:45	Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows 98; Q312461)	65.34.160.23

Many EC teaching locations still do not have the kind of equipment a modern      electronic classroom should have      i.e.      internet access      adequate projection devices      large-screen TVs      etc.                    #3.  There should be some compensation made for the large amount of travel by EC professors.  Traveling to another city or military installation to teach and conduct faculty meetings and faculty development is not the same as walking accross the hall to your classroom.

The administration seems to hire more and more highly paid administrators to produce climate surveys and the like      while hiring more and more low paid adjunct faculty and lecturers to provide freshmen and sophomores with their fundamental backgrounds in English      Science and Mathematics.  The hiring of qualified faculty to teach freshman and sophomores is a simple      worthwhile      and attainable goal that is essential to our institution's success.  Yet      the administration chooses to plan and survey more      and provide quality undergraduate faculty less.  The actions of the administration speak louder than their words.  It is time for the administration to start matching their actions to their promises to provide students with a quality education!                    In addition      the teaching      service      and research expectations placed upon the faculty are a complete joke.  We cannot walk on water!  Teaching a full load (12 hours) makes it impossible to have time to do research      especially when the faculty is expected to supervise the usual departmental "army of adjuncts      lecturers and non-tenured faculty" that we see in the typical ERAU academic department.                      Administators keep flying in your jets      attending your meetings      taking your surveys      making your empty plans and promises      placing unrealistic demands upon your faculty      and we may soon become the ENRON of higher education.

I love my job and will do it for whatever pay the "powers-that-be" deem appropriate      but with that said...the Center Director salary still remains significantly lower than it should be when duties and responsibilities are taken into consideration.          #17 -- I don't like how this question is put.  If asked if Daytona Beach and the Extended Campus work well togehter      I would Strongly Agree.  However      if asked if Prescott and the Extended Campus work well together      I would Strongly Disagree.  Here are just a couple examples of the problems I have with the Prescott Campus:  1)  An instructor of mine recently went to Prescott to enroll his daughter in her first semester of college; the person he was dealing with didn't even know that ERAU had an extended campus!!  2)  The Prescott admissions office often comes to my state for college fairs.  They do not notify us when they are coming or ask if we would like to have a representative at the ERAU booth.  Once      we showed up with separate booth's at the same fair -- not a real good demonstration of the "One University" concept.  Further      who's to say what kind of information they are providing potential students about the extended campus??

I also feel that there is no visibility by the faculty into the budgeting process (is there a real process?).  Further      I don't feel that there is sufficient focus at the administrative level for serious consideration of marketing to broaden the representation of degree programs -- ERAU is in danger of turning back into a trade school for pilots.

However      I do wish I felt more a real part of my department.   Some faculty members have been very friendly and helpful      while others ignore me (I have been a part-time adjunct for several years).  I've never been evaluated in any way. I wish someone would say      we think you're doing a good job.                    Regarding the question of equipment and materials      the classroooms in Buildings E and B are shaped bizarrely      making it difficult for all students to adequately see videos or sometimes even the board.

Clear and correct communication is essential; yet      it is the most difficult thing to accomplish. I am afraid we have not done a good job of communicating. While large meetings are important to allow all the opportunity to have their say      we need many more small group meetings to allow for more personal interactions; one-on-one is best. What is important? Interactions      Interactions      Interactions!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. I believe the lack of trust is a result of lack of interactions. We need to tell everyone what is going on      and explain why certain things are done. One can not form a team unless everyone is informed and is willing to buy in based upon trust that the truth has been told to all. We need to do our best to treat everyone fairly.

2	1	3	1	1	1	1	2	3	2	3	3	3	1	2	1	3	2	2	2	1	1	1	2	1	1	I have seen many improvements over the past four years.  I fully support the One University vision      however      it is apparent that not all areas do.  This does impede my ability to accomplish my goals.  I would like to see more consistent support of the One University direction across the campuses.  This needs to start at the top of the organization chart.  There are many pockets of support across the campuses and these areas need to be nurtured      recognized and rewarded for their efforts so others will see the benefit of "getting on board".            Sometimes I feel like we are moving too fast toward the 2010 vison and not investing enough resources in getting projects done right.  We tend to bite off more than we can handle with the limited human and financial resources. All the projects are important      but we need to focus on prioritizing our goals.  Yes      it keeps me challenged and never bored!                      I also feel that some of our ventures are misdirected or not throughly planned out      which cause us to spin our wheels needlessly and waste valuable time.  I understand the need to do preliminary planning in order to assess the viability of certain programs      but sometimes we are up to our necks before we realize a program may not be viable      for example CATER.  The MRO program appears to be doing well      but the avitation training program appears to have failed.  We heard plenty about it before      but now it is all quiet.  Perhaps more information on it would be helpful.  I also feel we need to focus more on our strategic goals and measure each proposal on how it will meet or address our goals.  We appear to be moving in the right direction on this front.  However      I have difficulty understanding how DCE offering a Financial Seminar meets one of our strategic objectives      or how their non-aviation courses meet our goals.  For example      if I wanted to take a PC troubleshooting class or Photoshop class I would look to DBCC or the various City Recreational Departments for that      not ERAU.                     I am proud to be a member of the ERAU family and truly enjoy working here.  We have many      many advantages and opportunities that are not available in other companies and I do appreciate that.  I am fortunate that the department I work in is dedicated and acknowledges individual and team contributions.  We all work hard and have fun while we are accomplishing our goals.  I couldn't ask for anything more.  ERAU is a great place to work!             Thank you for asking my input.

A 3% raise across the board is not very much for a person who makes below $25     000.  I think the management should forsake pay increases until such time as they improve the pay for the "little person" who actually makes this university what it is today.  Another percentage or two for the retirement fund would be a big help also.  It is very hard to save money when you don't make much money.  The cost of living in this area is very high and the salaries do not reflect it.  Try paying $600 a month for a decent apartment      car payment      car insurance      electric      phone      water      cable on $1000 a month.  Not to mention food.  It's easy to sit "upstairs" making $100     000 + a year and not have to worry what will happen to you if you should get downsized.

I also believe these surveys are just a means to justify a position created for the person to do a survey. Just what we need .. more consultants.

They need to know if the employees are happy and to research any problem areas.  They are not in these departments enough to know what is going on they only hear from the management of each department. There needs to be more open communication between upper management and the staff of each department. We need to work as teams. Victories are won by teams not individuals......

A conservative approach is not being taken toward spending.  There is much distrust and anxiety among staff toward the administration.  Staff do not have an advocate - they are at the mercy of the administration.  Do not feel everyone has an equal chance to apply for jobs - many are never advertised.  It appears special jobs are created for special people.  The atmosphere at ERAU is not good - people are fearful.

While continued efforts are being made to help improve the communication between campuses      there appears to be a long way to go for the communications process to be considered effective between campuses.  This problem also seems to continually exists between departments across campuses as well as between administration and departments.  The issue doesn't seem to be mechanical but rather just a matter of physically opening up those line of communication and building the trust among faculty and staff.                    22.  I feel that if properly handled      the climate survey can be an effective tool to help influence those decisions.  Whether that indeed is put into practice remains to be seen at this point in time.

There are far too many departments that still give students the "Riddle Run-around"!  It is so easy to pick up the phone and call another department and ask a question for a student or even have them ask the question instead of making the student run all over campus because its "not my job".                    And it happens to staff members as well!  We show no respect for other departments (flight gets the worst rap!) and it is crazy!                    We should have some type of forum to bring the departments together and ask the simple question: "what does your department do?"  That is not hard and I believe it would be a great way for all departments to understand what each one does and maybe respect them more.  Even if it is just a way to introduce each other at least we are doing something.                    The only time we see everyone is at the Christmas party and even then      most people don't even know who Dr. Ebbs is!  What is wrong with this picture?                    If we want to make this a better place for students      we need to start with our own faculty and staff!  Most people can tell that there are unhappy employess here for whatever reason.                    Make this a better place for everyone and I promise you will find a happier university overall!  And that starts with communication.                    Thank you.

The four or five "first-hired" full time EC faculty currently head all important committees      have tight control of all important key faculty appointments      and tightly control all EC faculty matters      to the detriment of faculty growth and job satisfaction.  Most of the remaining faculty languish in the malaise of this situation      and have motivationally withdrawn from full participation in faculty matters      where their opinion and input absolutely do not matter.  Particularly disturbing are the twice a year faculty senate meetings      where it is painfully obvious that consensus was reached prior to the meeting by the power brokers      and the resultant meeting is a sham that insults faculty intelligence.  Many of the faculty remain in hopes that they will be invited to the retirement party for their senior colleagues.

ERAU should be ran like a business.  In the summer when student enrollment is down      businesses that operate on campus like food service/book store/(and faculty) reduce their staff numbers or reassign to another project. ERAU staff should better utilize departments during the summer that have little or no business. For example counseling department/Career Services and possibly financial aide should be cross trained to work with corporate giving/alumni affairs and actually do something productive besides play computer games. Granted it isn't their fault that they have so few students during the summer but a real business would utilize unutilized resources in other areas during "seasonal" times.  By the way      CCC needs some experience in there - I've spent an inordinate amount of time helping students with resumes as the students feel CCC has no industry experience.  I understand CCC is pretty much alumni.  One worked selling makeup     other came from a bakery and still another walked off the baseketball court into a job creating resumes.  No wonder the students are frustrated and depend on faculty for career guidance. Also      for a school this size      those offices seem "too fat" with people.  What is the industry average for a school this size for CCC/Counseling?              Why isn't staff managed like a business and the faculty side of this "one university?"

Serious cases of sexual discrimination against women faculty      staff      and students. The hiring process of the director of summer programs is a total embarrasement to the University. The fact that there are NO women up for tenure and promotion speaks for itself. The only female faculty member in AS is being terminated!!!!

3	3	3	2	3	2	2	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	3	4	4	4	3	2	2	5	1	2	1	1	I've been here many years and there has always tended to be a lack of effective communication campuswide and mistrust of administration. I don't know if that ever will change.  Many folks are disenhearted when they find out how much money is being spent in the Development area in an effort to get donations.  Where's the donations?  And what's up with the corporate jet?  We were told that the jet was a 2 year deal we couldn't pass up.  Two years are up-- what now?  And the jet was marketed as a tool for departments to use.  Who can afford to fly on it?                       And      although there have been improvements in wages and benefits over the past several years      we we're so behind where we should have been that we'll never truly catch up. The structure of the pay system only seems to help those who are at the bottom.  As the rates increase those who are new get bumped up but those who have been here many years don't get bumped up accordingly. So the gap between new hire pay and the pay of long term employees becomes narrower.  If there is an equity adjustment for the bottom      the person who is not at the bottom should get the same amount in equity as well and then the supervisor should have the opportunity to give merit in addition to those who deserve it.  This does not occur. In our department alone I can cite several examples of people who have been here from 1 to 6 years.  They are all performing the same job and they all make the exact same amount.  How do you think it feels for the guy who has been here and given his all for 6 years to be making the exact same amount as someone who's been here 5 years less?                       Although our benefits package is not bad      it still could be improved upon.  Why can't the folks who have Florida Health Care be offered dental benefits?  Under the ERAU plan      dental is offered. ERAU is self insured so why can't those same dental benefits be extended to the folks who are FHCP?  Even if they had to pay extra      I'm sure most would opt to take it. People who are on FHCP do so as to not incur  out-of-pocket expense more so than for the quality of the program.  They can't afford to shell out $1700 per year in deductibles and co-pays.  Why should they not be offered an optional dental package? I could go on and on but will stop now.                       Hopefully this climate survey will be used as a tool to make improvements but it will be up to the administration to listen to people and take action.   Don't drop the ball or the low level working folks will never feel like they count.

My concerns can be summarized as follows:          1. The lack of truly shared governance.          2. A lack of effective communication between the Administration and the faculty.          3. Faculty input into important University decisions being overlooked.          4. A tremendous increase in staff positions with little to no increase in faculty positions.           5. Far too many courses taught by Adjunct faculty or as overloads. This saves the University money      but it takes away from the quality education our students should be receiving. A typical Professor      teaching 24 credit hours a year      is paid approximately $2     000 per credit hour. If that same Professor teaches a 3 hour overload      they are paid somewhere between $500 and $700 a credit hour. If they teach 6 extra credit hours in a Summer term      they are paid $1     000 per credit hour. Overloads and Summer pay should more closely match one's normal wage.          6. More money from the University budget needs to be spent on academics      and less on expanding other areas of the University. When the tuition was raised dramatically over a year ago      it was identified that this would provide a lot more money for academics (new equipment and additional faculty). It never happened. If the students and the quality of their education is the #1 priority      lets prove it.

Hiring military retirees works because they "don't need the money     " but considering the excess income from the EC to the university each year      a little consideration of the source is appropriate.  You couldn't hire this kind of talent from the civilian sector and get the results you do.             EC centers are first class operations run on a shoestring budget      tightly controlled by the HQ.  A bit of a one-size-fits-all mentality stifles initiative and deprives strong centers of funds (especially for technology) to compete with other military base schools for students      yet the diligent efforts of the CDs produce tremendous results.

I am a female who has been promoted and feel that my daily contributions in my position make a difference in the climate of the Prescott campus and the lives of the students.                    I will say that it seems the Prescott campus has a far bigger issue with a lack of diversity across the board than does the Daytona Beach campus. There are very few female directors and even fewer employees of color on the Prescott campus. The reason for the lack of employees of color may be significantly influenced by the lack of ethnic diversity in the Prescott/Tri-City area. I would hope that the administration would support the Diversity Council on the Prescott campus and seriously examine their recommendations for improving diversity.                     A huge improvement could be made on the Prescott campus by hiring a Human Resources professional with a Masters or PhD level degree in that field. Currently      the Human Resources department has been run for some time by a woman who is completely unqualified for her position. It would help the climate of the campus to hire an HR professional who understands the need for diversity and who has the confidence and the backbone to support this initiative.

I also believe that the stated intention of bringing the level of pay of ERAU employees up to national average was a good idea      but has not been implemented.  I believe that the PMP is one-sided: management evaluating staff with nothing set up to go the other way.  I do      however      believe that the benefits package offered by the University to it's employees offsets the rest to some extent.

It provides a point of contact for tracking progress.  The vagueness regarding implementation responsibility increases the risk of failure. Otherwise      there is a tendancy to assume "someone" else will take responsibility for implementation of these long term objectives.  Projected budgets need to also be clearly tied to various items in the strategic plan.                    The strategic plan objectives need to be tied to management's performance evaluations. Also      feedback mechanism needs to be in place for insufficient budgets to meet these goals.  Otherwise  come 2010 you may have disappointing news.  For example      can anyone say what percentage of our 2010 objectives we've already met or achieved?  The issue of 'assessment' in the survey left me scratching my head--assessment of what? Is there an assessment of far we've come along in meeting our strategic goals?                    In an atmosphere of tight budgets      which often impacts job-related ojectives (e.g. implementation of a special project) and calls for tution increases      it is hard to understand the seemingly abundant amount of money available for new buildings and renovations.   I think it would be in the interest of the university to explain this strategy and allocation of funds to its faculty and staff.  Is a new building really a strategic objective? Does it interfere with strategic budgeting?  Does it improve the odds of our graduating students finding good paying jobs.                    I was also troubled by the Career Services statistics recently sent out by Alicia Smyth showing an average starting salary of $19     000 for a student with a BS in Aeronautical Science with only a %50 placement rate. In my book      $19     000 is not acceptable salary for someone who has spent perhaps $80     000? to acquire a degree.  Either one of two things is happening: we are not providing value for the investment a student makes  or we're not properly presenting potential income.  I suggest you collect data on how these students fair 7 years from now. I think we owe it to our customers the students.

For example      we have budgeted for new hardware      have been told we will get the funds and then have had them removed from our budget (twice) without justification.  (Lack of available funds is a relative issue      the University certainly has the funds to spend on things that high level administrators think we need      while significant one-time requests (30-60K) are considered too costly ....                    ----                    While my current salarly is better than what I accepted when I came here a few years ago      it is still far below what I am worth and what I could get if I choose to leave.                    There continues to be a salary problem that keeps newer faculty (who tend to have more contemporary skills and therefore "do more" to advance a program than older faculty) at a pay rate below those who have "been here awhile."  It isn't my fault that these people have agreed to work for sub-par salaries (many have retirement incomes that equal their ERAU income).  I can't continue to support my family at my current income level (<50K with a PhD) .... It is somewhat insulting to not be able to "hold our own" in a neighborhood with a house painter next door      a fireman across the street      and a mechanic down the block.  None of these people have anything close to the education that I have.                    ----                    Summer pay is a joke - why would I work for 50% of what I normally work for when I already feel that my base is too low?                    I am hired to teach 12 credits each term.  If I teach 12 credits in the summer      than I should get 50% of my normal contract      not 25%!  The Florida State University system recognizes that teaching in the summer is more challenging (same material in less time) and they pay their faculty the same rate for 9 summer credits as they do for 12 fall/spring credits.  After all      don't we tell our students they can't register for more than 9 credits in summer as that is considerd "full time?"

After gearing up over the last decade to increase emphasis on stature      research      credentials      and breadth      the University has abandoned any observable commitment to moving ahead in a concerted manner in these arenas. There is a palpable feel of a return to training center priorities as opposed to the university culture we have been moving forward with the last few years. Allowing the vision of say the Prescott campus to remain unfocused unattended undeveloped and unresponded to is not new but it has increased in neglect. In addition      the University leadership seems unusually incapable of tolerating dialogue      consensus driven decision making      and alternative opinions and visions. In fact there seems to be a healthy level of vindictiveness built into organizational politics. The administration seems more interested in protecting itself than in improving the opportunities of the institution. Hiring processes are cynically subverted to accomplish these ends. Lack of clarity      lack of ability to entertain a vigorous dialogue      lack of ability to respond to the initiatives and proposals of those "below" the administration      all add up to a frustrating and unhealthy climate. Communication goes one way: bottom up. Apparently      one is supposed to intuit what the administration actually wants because "the plan"-- if there is one-- seems to be held in secret by only a few individuals. What a mess...

Scholarship is a prerequisite and a corequisite for good teaching because it legitimizes our expertise      informs our classroom practice      and provides students with models for intellectual inquiry.                      Scholarship also contributes significantly to Embry-Riddle's prestige and heightens our name recognition.  Check MIT's School of Humanities web cite      for example (http://web.mit.edu/shass/home_update/homepage_main.htm).  Prominently featured on the main page are the recent publications of its faculty.  MIT recognizes that its stellar reputation is based on the quality of its graduates AND the reputation of its faculty.                      When Embry-Riddle University professors are required to teach a community college teacher's teaching workload      we are not only harming our reputation      but also hiring      retention      and morale.  While we have taken small steps to address this problem      we need to strengthen our resolve.

I have great confidence in the CAO and Chancellor as the only academics in the administration of this academic institution      but fear that the proliferation of top-heavy bureaucracy and non-academic staff badly undermines the financial health and of the university and the morale of faculty and students.  No academic institution can be considered healthy when the staff to student ratio approaches 1:6      and staff to faculty ratio is 8:1.                     13. As has been reiterated on numerous occasions      no faculty member has any concept of how the university allocates resources.                    16. Contrary to some reports      9/11 in particular reinforced the notion that communication on this campus is severely flawed which permits counterproductive rumors/innuendos/misperceptions to flourish.                    22. Please release the results of the survey.  This alone      if nothing else      will reinforce the trust that the new administration is working so hard to foster.                    General: Students who are continually "run-around" become alumni who do not donate.  ERAU provides an excellent education and offers tremendous opportunities      but its students leave with resentment and bitterness.  This is not a marketting issue.

I do not think that is true of the whole campus. There is an unusual amount of back-biting and ill will in other areas.                    22.

The expectations for research now seem the same as at a major research institution but the teaching load is twice that at those schools.  Research is also not supported with space or equipment.  Teaching is also suffering due to lack of funding for equipment.                      I think there needs to be a reality check on the ability of our faculty to engage in research with the level of support the university is currently in a position to provide.  The professors I have observed are working extremely hard in their classes and should be respected for the excellent education they are providing our students.

Effective advertising should be a reasonable priority of allocations through EC.  Full mixed media coverage in major metropolitan areas should be a priority for positive promotion of the University.  EC Centers and DL are standing by ready to serve; yet the general public doesn't realize we exist.  A Nationwide ad campaign similar to the University of Phoenix would help create awareness and opportunity for new students.          New products (degrees) must be created in order for growth as well.                    #14.  Our pay remains too low for the complex      multi-faceted      working requirements that we must accomplish.

Earlier years demonstrated some challenges with a narrow minded      predominantly white male culture that left women and minorities without the same opportunities as their male counterparts. No vision was set to change the climate until more recent years. In the last 5 years we began to see the campus blossom. We saw initiative to promote equity in hiring by bringing in some(few)women to faculty      expanding programs that are essential to our global world needs and with Dr. Quigley we saw an advocate for justice when questions and concerns among faculty were voiced. With the implementation of the new leadership(Dan Carrell and co.) and the loss of a Prescott icon(Dr. Quigley)      a rapid demoralizing climate has developed. There is fear of retaliation among faculty and staff if issues are raised. We are in the saddest state I have ever experienced in my years at ERAU. I foresee the loss of multiple tenured faculty and staff members as a result of the this appointment of Dan Carrell. He is not qualified nor is he respected by the majority of the campus employees. He has demonstrated unfairness and prejudice in his hiring practices and his unwillingness to promote women and/or support issues of diversity. He has surrounded himself with like minded white male men and this select biased group makes university and campus decisions without input from faculty or staff. The present state and climate of the campus is unacceptable and I will seek employment elsewhere when the opportunity arises. If there is change      I will reconsider.

The students and staff often feel that the Prescott campus is the "red-headed step child" of the university.  I have heard faculty comment on how "poorly run" the business side of the university is.  It is my impression that ERAU is doing what Makita power tools did.  Makita was the premier cordless power tool manufacturer.  They were rated tops in that field.  They set back and rested on their reputation and got blown away by DeWalt      Black & Decker and a whole raft of others and have never gained the top since.  ERAU appears to be taking that tract.  I have been told directly by an alumni that ERAU will not get any money from them until there is an improvement in the conditions      priorities and overall attitude of the school.  I now of dozens of students who are dropping Aeronautical Science for Aerospace Studies so they can fly elsewhere and not get charged so much money.  Others are looking into transferring to UND      Daniel Webster and Purdue due to costs.  I am 38 yoa      returning to school to complete my degree.  I have taken a staff position which has allowed me to start classes earlier than I thought possible.  I have run into a problem working co-op opportunities on campus with third party companies      because      and I quote HR "you are a staff member taking classes and are NOT considered a student.  You can not work on campus as that will put your hours worked into overtime and if that is the case      you will have to be paid a stipend with the money coming from the budget of the College of Arts and Science."  Not very conducive to encouragement for those of us who have work experience and wish to better ourselves.  I do not the luxury of rich parents furnishing me an education      nice car      fraternity dues      beer money and lawyer fees so I don't have to be responsible.  (The last sentence is how the majority of the students are viewed by members of the staff and local community.)  I am closely associated with the STG program.  In light of 11 September      this is a field that is going to be in great demand and one that benefit students      staff      faculty      ERAU      and the United States if developed.  Thank you for this opportunity to express my views.  I feel that this is a valuable resource.  with respect      an ERAU staff member of 1-1/2 years.

I often get the impression that they only "put up" with us because we contribute significantly to the University budget.  We are given some support in the office and classroom but in the HR/Health Benifit/Payroll areas we are tossed scraps.                    The Conpensation project a couple of years ago was a joke.  We were promised we would be compensated with the local cost of living taken into account.  Then there was almost no increase for the Director and no increase at all for the Assistant.  We live in a place where a fixer-upper 2 bedroom house in a neighborhood one block from the ghetto appraises at $270K but we are paid on a Florida cost of living rate where a 2 bdrm condo can cost $35K.  This causes much disillusionment about what administration thinks of us out here.  They spent months building up the Comp project then did nothing in the places where it should have counted most.                    I recently had a physical with a Pap test.  I personally paid over $200 for this $400+ visit because ERAU only pays $200 for a physical. The part I paid doesn't even apply to my $250 deductible      that's just my cost.  My doctor and labs do not charge exhorbitant fees for our area -- ERAU is cheap.  Also      the current health plan doesn't have a clue about what the difference is between the term "symptom" and "diagnosis."  I'm billed based on what my doctor finds      not the symptom      or reason      I had an appointment in the first place.  I go in to check my borderline blood pressure and it is normal      yea!  My insurance refuses to pay for the visit because the diagnosis stated that I'm ok.  Hello?!?  I requested an HMO option for Health coverage and was refused.  I used to process health claims.  I know this is garbage.                    These are examples of what I mean when I say we are valued only for dollars we contribute instead of as respected members of the ERAU community.  We are exptcted to produce      but we are maintained with the least possible cost because most of us are military spouses and will be moving on in a couple of years anyway so it doesn't really matter.  Except what about those who aren't planning a PCS?  What about the civillians who compare our jobs within the civillian world and are apalled?

I love working for ERAU and helping the students' dreams come true.  The Extended Campus administration is always willing to help and assist the centers to make our job easier.  However      I can not say the same for the top leadership.                    Since taking over as center director      we have doubled our enrollments (leading our region for the past year).  While my regional manager has been very supportive      Daytona Beach has ignored our accomplishments.  Our center has had little or no contact with the top leadership of the university.  In fact      literature sent to me from the president is always addressed to my predeccessor who no longer works for the university.  It does not boost our morale knowing that the president does not know who we are.                    As for strategic planning      the budget manager at DB is requesting that we double our projected enrollments for the next fiscal year.  Since we just doubled our enrollments this year      doubling enrollments again does not seem to be wise strategic planning.  This is hardly a vote of confidence.                    In addition      the centers need to be involved in pricing.  Across the board price increases every year are poor marketing.  EC students believe that the extra money just goes to the main campus to build facilities or make up for budget shortfalls.

My position has been reclassified twice in the last 2 1/2 years and a few times more over the years.  However my longevity has precluded me from receiving "any" additional pay.  Thus I train people so they can perform the same job as I've been actively doing for 20+ years and I only gross slightly more money than they do because of reclassifications.  The message this relays is ERAU doesn't appreciate longevity in their employees.

Is the university specifying some goal or quota for such categories of employees? If so      that would imply there is some reverse discrimination coming into play      discriminating against others that are not females or minorities. It also implies an anti "equal opportunity" bias if some ERAU initiative is pursued to discriminate on the basis of age      race      color      creed      or national origin in hiring      recruiting      or selection practices.

However      I do think the training is a cookbook          approach      and may not be sufficients for pilots to think          and respond to emergencies. What if all the electronics fail?          More emphasis should be placed on what-if scenarios. While          99 % of the time      flying is pretty standard      the remainder          is the critical part.

The personnel evaluation process is a miserable drill to go through      especially for large departments. Most employees I have spoken with feel that      in the end      budget decisions are made at the university level with little regard for the strategic plan.

Prime example is the format for the instructor folders. I have redone all folders three times in my four years and am currently waiting for the format to change again before I change to the current format which was changed the day I finished formatting them from the previous change. Confused about what is the correct one? So are we!                    It is a shame but depending on what decision you want concerning a situation with a student      you call and see who is at work before you ask the question or send the e-mail.

I encourage whomever reads this survey to read a book called "NUTS"      it's a story about Southwest Airlines and its management tactics.  One learns a great deal of effective management and empowerment of the employee workforce.  I see too much competition among Center Directors.

More money is always welcome      but there are other considerations that would make for a better environment in which to work.                    Better communication between depts.      campuses and faculty is needed.  A little more involvement by upper management to try to really understand the things we do and the obtacles we face each day would go a long way for morale.                      Many people do not have the technological equipment or software needed to perform their job properly.  There is a lack of space in which large departments can work. Efficiency is lost and services to students are split all over campus.                    Every year there is a budget crisis      and the lower level staff  have to cut back on all supplies and traveling      while the belief is that the upper management continues to spend at will.                    There is much trepidation regarding a huge tuition increase in such a slow economic environment.  Many people are concerned that if we don't pull in the class expected      jobs will be eliminated.                    There is a pattern of decisions being made without consultation or input from the faculty or staff that those decisions directly impact.  There is much insight that could be gleaned from talking with the "front lines".                    ERAU is one of the best places to work in the Daytona Beach area.  But the potential is there for a much more enjoyable      and definitely for a much more productive workplace.

I do feel extremely fortunate to work with some of the most experienced flight instructors in this industry. I am grateful for having a fleet maintenace staff that responds to each and every discrepency I may write up about an aircraft      no matter how small the problem may be. I do however feel like a second class citizen. Every month      all of the instructor pilot's gather for a meeting where we hear time and time again how important we are to this university. "We are where the rubber meets the road"      as Mr. Theokis would say. Is that true?          I feel that as a full time employee      we should be compensated for full time work. I can't even begin to count how many 12 hour days are spent at the Riddle flight line      and to go home knowing that you were just payed for 5 hours      or even less. The problems may be lack of aircraft available      maintenance problems      student no shows      weather      all of which I have no control over. I take my job extremely seriously knowing that each and every time I take a student up flying      it is my responsibility to get them back on the ground safely so they can do it all again the next day. To have that kind of responsibility and know that I can make more money at the local drive through is pretty disturbing. I do enjoy working at ERAU      but only because I have made some great friends there      and I know that the airplanes are maintained to extremely high standards. Other than that      I feel it is like a jail sentence. Just serving my time before I get paroled. We hear that ERAU is the best aviation university in the world      employing only the best instructors. Maybe then you should treat us like we are. We are not asking for much      just to be payed when we are at work. Is that too much to ask?           Thank you for your time.......good luck in June!

I feel that most decisions are made without input or thought of the Prescott campus or the extended campuses.  I don't feel that this is done because of any malice      I feel that the other campuses are just so removed that they are just not thought of.  I would like to see the University Administration in a seperate location so that all campuses can be equally represented and supported without the involement of only one very prominent voice.                      I think the university also does a lot of lip service regarding diversity.  It is very difficult for international students      females (students      faculty      and staff) and students of color to look to anyone on our campus for mentoring.  We seem to be stuck in the ex-military      male hiring mode.  This does not bring diversity to our campus.                      I realize that every institution has areas where they need to improve and Embry-Riddle is no exception.  However      I do believe that Embry-Riddle is a great place to work because of the freedom allowed to employees to make decisions in relation to their area of work.  I do feel that Embry-Riddle is keeping abreast with issues in relation to education and within the work place.  I appreciate the opportunity to participate in the survey.

For appearence sake      Presidential fund raising efforts seem extravagant and not in line with the sacrafices people have to make every day to survive financially.  Raises of 3% do not compensate for increasing housing costs in this area. Work loads increase      expectations increase      but the compensation is lack luster.                    The VP administration seems very top heavy!  The Development Department seems very fat!  Where's the results?  My advice      get these folks off DAB campus so they aren't a slap in the face of the peeons who work here for the efforts of the DAB campus.  They drive in their fancy cars and make the big bucks      as you know the rumor would lend us to believe      but we see budget shortfalls and nit picking by the accounting office over pencils. Delays      delays      delays... can anyone make a decsion in a reasonable amount of time?  Does everything have to be a committee?  Dr. Ebbs seems to be the only one who will make a snap decision      good or bad      at least he has guts.                      The President's choice to ignore popular centiment with regards to Dr. Connolly remaining as Chancellor      is still fresh in the minds of the faculty and staff.  The perception is      that Dr. Connolly had the guts to say no to Dr. Ebbs and Dr. Ebbs doesn't like to be told "No."  So be it.  Dr. Ebbs has made it quite clear he is running this campus as evidenced  by his town meetings and I'll paraphrase      if you don't like it here      leave attitude.  Notice the mass exodus of Department Chairs.  This doesn't lend itself to confidence in the leadership and the loyalty that is requested. I only hope he knows what he is doing and will be a hero in the end.  To Dr. Price's credit      he seems to be a nice fella... so far.  Dr. Ebbs      let him do his job and run the Daytona Campus.  Stop cyphoning funds to prop up the "1" University.                    Staff reviews are cumbersome and lends itself to lip service.  Bottom line      people are let go here on the whim of a budget cut (CATER). The creation of new positions without proper advertising and interviews      i.e. created jobs for individuals assistants to the VP's and President's office. This is fine      just be honest that this is done.  It is in no way meant to critisize the efforts of the people who get these positions.  In fact I'm glad they are still here.  Just makes the rest of the hard working people wonder what they need to do to be tapped for one of these gravy jobs.                    Just to let you know      Human Resources is not thought of highly. Confidentiality is a joke      employee supervisor disputes are not reported.  Their main purpose is perceived by many as being the "hatchet people."  Poor Irene McReynolds being labeled with that reputation is unfair.                      WEQC: A committee to put on a party a few times a year?  Please      disband this charade.  They don't tackel real issues like a Day Care Service on Campus      employee benefits for same gender partners      reciprocol agreements with other Universities for the Masters and Doctoral candidates      parking for staff      rising health insurance      geriatric care for those with infirm parents.                      One last thing      you want the alumni to have loyalty and donate back to ERAU.  You have to cultivate the students you have now.  Parking is an irratant      deal with it!                      Where are the recreational spaces      the lounge spaces?  Student Life departments are spread all over the place.  When's the last time someone seriously thought about a Student Union?                     Alumni Affairs is in Development?  Why?  It sends a clear message you want their money not their friendship.  Bob Rockett has the relationship with the alumni      they want to see him on trips      why isn't he running that effort?  He's been here for 25 years I think?  Isn't that about the right age group for doners?  The younger alumni want to come back and "party" during homecoming.  Make this easy for them.  True they don't have the money now      but in 10 year or so      see the investment pay off.  Notice who these people come back to see      their club advisor      the buds in the housing department      their supervisor of their job.  That secretary has a huge impact on their lives      does anyone care?  We focus on the relationship with the faculty.  Some do of course      but when the average faculty teaching load is over 100 people      they can't possibly mentor to all those students.  They seek out all the "staff" around them to share their lives.  Lets get moving on these issues.  You'll see the morale he will improve.

I don't select texts      influence syllabus requirements or course descriptions      or have much other input.  I am given a syllabus      text      and many rules to follow.

The "quiet period" is over and we should be seeing some significant results.  The strategic decision to focus fundraising on industry executives was a mistake from the beginning and actually turned out to be a disaster after 9/11.  We have thousands of "missing" alumni who should be the ones on whom we focus for endowment - but it appears to some faculty that the draw of developing personal contacts for personal gain may be driving this approach - while finding      contacting and soliciting alumni appears too tough and provides little opportunity for our development people to "hob=nob with the big wheels".  I personally think our management of our large alumni family is totally unacceptable and should be far higher on our priority than last.  The are groups of people who are the permanent and long-lasting foundations of any university - alumni and tenured faculty.  Embry-Riddle has never recognized this and the endowment and annual fund statistics points this our loud and clear.

For instance      the Applied Aviation Sciences Department removed          AT363      Introduction to Air Traffic Control      without even notifying the EC.   The course just disappeared from the catalog one summer.  Although that course was no longer needed for Daytona      it was an excellent introductory course in ATC      with an excellent text      and a very relevant course with ATC tower/RAPCON "labs" at every location with a runway.

The current setup is rather like that of a community college. If we agree that we want a university known for the quality of its students and its professors      then steps should be taken to allow professors to choose a track emphasizing their strengths      with appropriate channeling of time      activities      and focus. This setup should be regulated by a system of checks and balances which responsibly measure whether adjustments in courseload have led to productivity in the area(s) selected/emphasized for which a lightened load was allowed in other areas.                    8.  It can be difficult to have confidence in the University leadership is there are regular changes in academic hierarchies      frequent turnover and changing of positions      conspicuous priviledge for and funding of administrative departments      apparently at the expense of funding of faculty and academic support departments.  What does it take to agree and see concrete      fiscal evidence that our purpose is teaching and academics      supported by administration.

WE have lost two good people      Cap Parlier and Peter Quigley      both of whom had a vision for this campus and fought for our interests.  Despite the promise of a full search for a new Chancellor      we now have an imposed Chancellor      who lacks any of the broader qualities needed for credibility--good credentials      a real vision      a management style that accepts discussion and consultation and that actively seeks to improve the diversity of the campus.  It seems the only real criteria for Chancellor is the capacity to bow and scrape to the univ admin.  Instead      we are going the other way      to an an intellectually impoverished vision      allegations of nepotism      sexual harrassment      a disinclination to hire the best candidate because she is a woman      disdain for faculty governance      and a management atmosphere that engenders fear      not respect or collegiality.  In the inimitable words of John Dean to President Nixon      these issues are like a cancer eating at the heart of the campus.  Has anyone at the univ admin ever read our own colonial history--of how the actions taken by King George      Lord North and the Royal Governors to hold on to the colonies actually set off the revolution? The only way PC can really prosper is to have a much greater level of autonomy--trying to ram these campuses into some narrow framework called "one university" just isn't going to work.  We're here two thousand miles away      we have the West Coast and the Pacific Rim      we're different in many ways.  We have enormous potential      energy      vitality.  But instead to using all that to build a great future      we are blocked by a seemingly sclerotic administration and diverted into anger at this senseless imposition on us of a governor whom we do not want.

This may be simply a lack of communication and a failure to "Manage By Walking Around" (MBWA).  However      whether you do not lead      or simply do not listen and communicate      you still fail the leadership test.   We have a great educational niche market in aviation and we need to exploit it fully. Since most of the key management team is new (at least academic leadership) I will reserve judgement.

Question 8          The leadership of ERAU seems to be more interested in special          events such as expensive golf outtings      dinners and meetings          held in locations all over the country (not just in the US).          We are a private university that is dependent on tuition          dollars. The money spent on the Citation Jet (for maintenance and pilots) along with all the money the university spends entertaining should go towards improving our academic programs and the student life on campus. When that happens then everyone will know the university leadership truly cares about Embry-Riddle and our future.                      Questions 9-11          Faculty and staff spend many hours going through the strategic planning processes. They list their department's priorities and goals for the future but never see the fruits of their labor. You have managers and staff busy doing strategic planning      the PMP Human Resources document (which is ridiculous and taking a major step backward in streamlining the process of performance reviews)      and going to a myriad of meetings -- when is a person supposed to have time to devote to their job and our students?                     Question 13          What resources? Last year we were told to turn off lights and computers because of budget woes. We have been told that the budget dollars for next year (May 2002) are going to be exactly the same as last year's budget. No new allocations are expected. How can we improve our programs if our budgets stay the same or decrease? Except for the Development Office - their budget and staff continues to grow. Its almost as if "they can't spend it fast enough" on their lavish trips      entertainment      and the jet.                     Also      the leadership wasted thousands of dollars on remodeling the building in Deland and purchasing a new sign for CATER -- knowing that the program would not succeed. I'm sure there has been additional waste in other similar projects. Example: they move administrative offices and people like they are playing musical chairs. No thought to cost or taking the time to think it through. How many times has the alumni office moved (upstairs      downstairs)      and development      and the academic office      etc.                     Our university continues to grow but the faculty/staff to support it stays the same. Emphasis is on bringing in more students and building more buildings but not hiring additional qualified faculty and staff.                     Question 15          Everyone knows that the only reason the "glass ceiling" was lowered recently was so the university would look good for the SACS visit in April.                     Question 17          I personally do not think the "One University" concept is working. How can it? You have three totally different campuses. Even the academic programs on each campus are different.                     Question 19          Despite the many neutral and disagrees I have checked      overall the university is a good place to work. We have come a long way since Bunnell days. But there's so much more we could do with the proper resources and leadership. Its frustrating to see so many good employees unhappy with our current leadership. We seem to be going backward instead of forward. I have noticed a decline in the respect and trust toward the university's leadership.                     Are you sure this will remain anomymous?

It also leaves the Daytona Beach Administration with very little credibility within the extended campus arena!                      The workload of the extended campus center is over whelming!  There is no time for a learning curve or professional development pursuits.  We are reduced to being re-active instead of pro-active to our students/faculty needs and concerns.  Putting out fires becomes our priorities!                     My center is an excellent example of Team work at its highest level.  The committment made by the ENTIRE staff is unmatched by any other office I have ever worked in.                        The "Human Factor" value is still the most important gauge of a company's continued success and Embry-Riddle continues to push the value placed on their employees further down the priority list.

The closest they come is in the comments section and there is generally too much to say relating to any topics.  It might also be important to understand that there is an extremely big difference between the "brick and mortar walls" of either of the main campuses and the extended campus environment.  A survey      even one with these Likert scalings      can hardly have an influence on decisions to improve the University as a whole when the whole university is so diverse in its requirements to fulfill the mission      goals and vision it has established.                    2.  The communication among inidiviuals on specific subjects is excellent regardless of their position within the university.  Communication at any level higher than that is fair when it works but normally is inconsistent.  It gets worst the greater the administrative level difference between the two parties involved until certain parties      like Ed Landgren or Emmert Lowery      are involved or there is the chance for a personal contact situation.  It also needs to be remembered that answers similar to "Because that's the way it is." do not invite open dialog when a subordinate hears that answer from "an Administrator back in Daytona Beach."  In education money is needed to get the wheels started going around but full      honest      open communication      and student service oriented people are what keep the wheels lubricated well enough to keep them going even when funds are scarce.

We are all overworked and have literaly zero time to spend in professional development on a weekly basis. The greatest difficulty is the level of service expected at the department level. The number of courses should be reduced to 3 so that the current department service can be achieved or a greater number of faculty should be given release time to take on some of these duties & thus allow time for faculty professional development.

A formal orientation - one day in length each month - for new employees is neeed.

2	3	3	3	3	2	2	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	4	3	3	3	3	1	5	3			1		ERAU could be a unique and positive force in post-secondary education if administrators and faculty would work together to (1) preserve the natural environment of its campuses      especially the Prescott Campus; (2) create checks and balances on all people in power; (3) encourage and reward effective teaching      not just work resulting in "external recognition" for ERAU.            The first wish stems from an increasing need for and awareness of the importance of open space.  A few campuses ahead of their times have recognized this priority and are preserving their land instead of building on it.  The second wish evolves from seeing some crazy actions of people in power at ERAU      such as one individual losing a great deal of money for ERAU      another individual giving or not giving merit raises without any explanation      to name just two. People may claim such checks and balances exist      but they do not      as is evident by what some people in power have been able to do      to the detriment of ERAU.  The third desire is catalyzed by seeing faculty receive tenure and other rewards mainly because of their research      not because of their teaching or involvement with students.  Good research and decent teaching can lead to tenure and promotion; decent research and good or even fine teaching does not.          When will staff and faculty see the results of and plans in response to the survey?

Furthermore      serving as the troubleshooter between Computer Support over technical issues with computers does not add to a better working environment      when the centers are the customer service component in the field.                    2.  Last year parallels most years.  Field staff workloads are still not realistic.  Additional responsibility      for example      distance learning      takes away from time to commit to other duties.  Enrollments are a plus      center staff are interrupted my the daily flow of customer needs      now add this to the mix.  Frequent interrupts result in starting and stopping work duties      and with some projects it's requires you review to return back to what you were doing      before one can move ahead.          There is insufficient time to do our duties in a day      and even in a week.                      3.  Center assistants do not field their efforts count when dealing with departments from time to time.  Sometimes      I perceive this is changing      but change is a slow process.  Assistants have a more difficult time perceiving this.                      5.  My boss is fair.  If centers have difficulty getting their workloads done       I am not convinced the allocation of responsibilities to my boss is fair.                    14.  There is progress in pay      but it does not meet the money requirements to cover the cost to live in our area.  It is still evident      most employees could not work for ERAU without a  form of second income:  retirement check      working spouse      and/or second job.                    18.  Faciltiy conditions at some locations ERAU staff work under is not indicative of this.  Low pay is not indicative either.                      19.  Overall      the employees      I come into contact with daily      make ERAU a good place to work.                      20.  If they produce change.                    22.  My feelings are mixed:  change is slow      and sometimes it is hard to accept it can not happen more quickly.

(For staff.  I really have no idea what faculty makes.)          I enjoy my job because I have full and constant contact with students and parents      and I don't have time to get bogged down with office and university politics.  My department is kept in isolation as our work load is so high we don't have time to get away to participate in any extracurricular campus activities.  Also      much of our time is spent justifying what we do so that we can report to Daytona Beach to justify our exsistence.  I know our counterpart in Daytona Beach does not have to spend time doing so.  This does nothing to improve inter-campus relationships.           Again      I love my job      and would not do anything else on campus.  I have worked at another major university and know the budget is always a problem      and equipment for employees is always the last priority.            I am in full-agreement with the 10 year plan and am working to do my part to accomplish our goals.  I hope we can all work together to achieve our goals.          Thank you for the opportunity to fill out this survey.  	Climate	3.00.63	Tue Feb 18 2002 21:36:27	Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.01; Windows 98)	12.64.228.174	6v8l301

That would be nice! CD of the Year was not awarded last year & they should also add ACD of the Year as well. ACDs work just as hard!
